(I've fallen asleep and woke up to a \"your dead\" screen and can't get back what i lost for items including money.\nIf you make a baby, and don't hold it or feed it, the \"government\" takes it away and babies are REALLY hard to keep pleased.\nDynamite can be used to blow open walls, doors, ramparts and does 10k damage, however walls even concrete walls only have a max of 6k \"hp\" concrete rampart gates have 24k which is ok but still only 3 tnt is needed. I tried using a cannon but cannons only did 850 dmg so there's a HUGE inbalance of \"hp\" vs dmg.\nWhen you exit the game, the game puts you into a sleeping bag and your avatar STAYS in game....so anyone raiding you can kill you take EVERYTHING in your base/castle as well as everything that you were carrying while AFK/not in game.\nThere are just so many things wrong with this game I can't even list them all. That being said, it DOES have ENORMOUS potential IF the devs keep updating and fixing the game.

Even funny is the fact on one of the loading screens it says your base can be for profit or protection, or decide if the land is for profit or protection. Not for profit I can almost garantee there is no profit. Your just better off collecting. So go mining for rocks and chopping trees and resale them, cause there is the profit.

{"product_id": "673130", "page": 1, "page_order": 4, "recommended": false, "date": "20 May", "text": "So we've had a glut of retro FPS action lately, with the stand-out one for me being DUSK, clearly inspired by a mixture of Blood and Quake. With a sick soundtrack, good graphics, excellent gameplay and a fun arsenal.\nThen there's AMID EVIL, which is clearly Heretic-inspired with its arsenal of magic weapons and slightly dark-fantasy theme. Unlike DUSK, though, it's not exactly well-executed. It feels like one of those mid-90's cash-in-on-the-fad knockoff FPS games that didn't have a single creative mechanic or idea behind them and were only tested enough to make sure that they didn't crash on launch.\nFirst off, you fire up the game, and your eyes bleed. A combination of colours and font make the menu almost unreadable until you've spent about half an hour pounding nails into your eye sockets. I'm exaggerating a bit for comedic effect, but it's really, really bad and the fact that no one apparently realized this before presenting it to the unexpecting public says a lot about how much the AMID EVIL team care.\nThen, you set up your options, load in, fall in the water... try to climb out of the water and... uhhhhhhh... so AMID EVIL has a severe problem with letting you out of water. It feels like you have to abuse the game physics to make it happen, and it's the biggest struggle I've encountered in the game. The biggest struggle certainly isn't what weapon to use, or dealing with the enemies.\nEvery situation I encountered was solved by holding down fire and circlestrafing, when the encounter wasn't in a narrow corridor where strafing and dodging wasn't even an option, that is. \"Uninspired\" and \"uncreative\" would be the main descriptors for the gameplay. It's not even offensively bad, it's just there. Which really explains most of the game. \"Just there.\" Kind of soulless. The soundtrack's okay, I suppose. But like the combat, the visuals are... just a grainy melange where nothing stands out.\nI think they might've been trying to introduce some sort of ELEMENTAL system since I noticed my GREEN GUN shots cancelling out certain enemy RED GUN shots, but since it's in no way explained or hinted at, and there's no telling if certain colours of shoot do more damage to certain colours of enemy, it's hard to tell. Also it's weird that green and red would cancel out since the intuitive classic would be blue and red, water and fire, while not colour theory opposites they ARE thematic opposites.\nThe one mechanic the game has besides MOVE and SHOOT is SOUL MODE. Where after you kill a bunch of enemies and pick up the glittery stuff they leave behind, you can enter a brief overcharged mode(extendable during its run by collecting more Enemy Glitter) that makes your guns shoot faster, harder and sometimes slightly differently. It's pretty blatantly the effect of that one usable item in Heretic.\nSpeaking of which, you've got a modern take on a classic game, and yet somehow it has less functionality? What made Heretic stand out from the competitors at the time was the inventory of usable items, something Doom and Doom 2 hadn't had, but this game only has Move and Shoot. There isn't even a Use button, you just bump your head into things or shoot them.\nApparently the game's got a staggering seven episodes or something now, and I'll confess that I only played part of the first one. Maybe it changes. Maybe there's a large tutorial on the effects of elemental resistances or the protagonist suddenly finds a backpack and a pair of hands so he can use items and carry an inventory around. Maybe the enemies become something other than generic colour-coded skelemans with a couple of different kinds of projectile.\nMaybe there's a fight you can't circlestrafe your way out of.\nHowever, AMID EVIL had its chance to sell me on its premise, and it failed. I can't really in good faith recommend this game unless you're extremely desperate for a shooter experience with less charm, worse graphics and shallower gameplay than Serious Sam.", "hours": 0.5, "username": "PurpleXVI", "products": 667, "found_helpful": 2, "early_access": true}

This is a good - not perfect - successor to HEXEN, to be fair HEXEN wasn't without flaws either.\nThe gameplay is pretty similar: you run through mazes searching for keys while gathering health items, green and blue mana, all while battling various enemies by using mostly magical weapons at range. These consume either green, blue or both mana (which basically is just a fancy term for \"ammunition\"). Sound familiar? There are no real puzzles, and unlike HEXEN there are no multi-level switch/key searches or hubs - simply search for the key and find the exit.\nLevels are huge and confusing and there is no automap - which probably wouldn't be of much help since the mazes are vertical AND horizontal. The level design is pretty darn good with a world that drew much inspiration from QUAKE (1). It controls well and is fast just like DUSK. Combat is highly satisfying while you strafe around enemies, throwing magic missiles at them, which works from quite a distance.\nIf you liked HERETIC or HEXEN you will definitely like AMID EVIL.", "hours": 2.6, "username": "Jezebel1988", "products": 177, "early_access": true}

The levels look great, the music suits the tone of the game, the controls feel solid, and the overall challenge level feels fair. I'm gonna leave a recommendation just because I respect what the devs have done here so far.\nThe main problem I've had is that I feel like I just finished the game (the 6 early access episodes at least) on Autopilot. I feel like most of my enemy encounters involve circle strafing around monsters that either shoot a projectile or charge at you. Each episode has it's own unique set of enemies, but don't quite feel unique enough to shake up my plans or strategies.\nLevel design feels a similar way. Many levels have some cool architectural design, but usually just involve a button sequence or a key hunt to split up fighting hordes enemies in fairly open spaces. I'd love if there were more surprises, because it generally felt very predictable. Even when the game decides to unleash a monster trap on you after grabbing a key, you start to expect it after it having happened on the last several maps.\nOverall, I'll say I thought the game was decent, I just don't think it's the kind of game I'll be thinking about months or even years from now.

I have played some Duke Nukem and Shadow Warrior back in the day but mostly I played Quake Arena and Unreal Tournament. I am especially into the aesthetics of Heretic/Hexen games. I love gothic horrorish themes like Dark Souls series.\nThis game is a great blend of the old school and the modern 360 view. It is a bit repetitive but challenging enough. Level designs vary from really good to average. Some feel very short while some overstay their welcome. But I am not big buff of good level design (aside from getting excited over Dark Souls' level designs and Zelda dungeon designs). None of that is here but I believe these fast paced old school shooters while usually feature neat level designs, they are mostly about encounters and the weapons.\nAlmost all of the weapons are super fun to use. I really like their designs as well. I really love the \"soul mode\" which is a timed overdrive mode that uses the charge you gather over time. It is a fun mechanic that helps defeat big encounters with ease.\nI am not a very good gamer but I have gamed all my life, so not completely bad at them either. I have chosen the Medium difficulty and I must say it has been just right, maybe even on the easier side but so far I have only played 3 chapters, and the new one was definitely harder and I even died a couple of times.\nAll in all, if you are looking for a fast paced action, this one is a good romp that most anyone who likes the genre would enjoy.

{"product_id": "673130", "page": 3, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2019-04-21", "text": "Second of two reviews of New Blood's old-school shooters. See review of Dusk here:\nFirst thing I must say: I actually wasn't a fan of Heretic and Hexen. Although I did play them and they were good, I was more of a Doom and Quake player - relying on shotgun and rocket launcher instead of magic. So I also had my doubts for Amid Evil. But I found myself short on good and more or less modern shooters I didn't try already. Ah well, here we go.\nAs an old-school shooter Amid Evil doesn't have any plot. Except classic \"you're a good guy who fights evil\", which is hardly considered a plot. Even Dusk had much more story than this while being in the same \"old-school\" boat. Speaking shortly - you're a Champion armed with axe who travels through different dimensions (every episode is a different dimension) slaying evil guys and gods along the way. Game contains seven episodes and each episode contains exactly four levels. Three levels are a mazes filled with different enemies while in fourth level you meet a boss. No secret levels. And that makes 28 levels. Every episode feels different and contains its own style and enemies, so you might find episode that is good exactly for you. For example, first episode is a pretty generic dark fantasy, while second is inspired by a Lovecraft literature and so forth.\nAlright, alright, but how does it play? Well... It's different. As I mentioned above, every episode has its own setting and enemies. And every episode plays differently. While in first episode enemies are weak and usually you don't even have to switch weapons. Even first boss is weak so you can beat him in a matter of seconds. It doesn't leave a good impression. But if you continue playing - this will change. In every episode there are more types of enemies and they are becoming stronger. Later in the game some enemies can easily defeat you if you are careless so you have to be careful and use right weapons to fight them. Speaking of weapons - there's not much of them. You always start with axe - simple and weak weapon. All other weapons are projectile and use different types of mana. Staff of the Azure Orb (staff that shoots blue orbs, basically machine gun) and Voltride (trident that shoots lightning, equivalent of lightning gun) uses blue mana, Star of Torment (mace that shoots multiple crystals at a time, a shotgun) and Whisper's Edge (sword, releasing green energy wave) uses green mana, Celestial Claw (staff with claws that shoots miniature planets, works as a rocket launcher) uses orange mana and Aeturnum (basically a magic BFG but purple) uses purple mana. That's pretty much all, seven weapons. AFAIK there are no plans to add more weapons. A pity, actually. These weapons have some different features though. Staff's orbs are flying to enemy even if you miss, sword can deflect some of enemy's projectiles and can go through multiple enemies at once, trident makes enemies explode and hurt those who nearby and mace just nails enemy to nearest wall on enemy's flying trajectory. And yes, they can fly. At least when you use mace against them. Another detail is a soul mode. Dying enemies leave their souls and Champion upon collecting enough souls can use soul mode to strengthen his weapons. It works especially good with Aeturnum and allows you to create miniature black holes.\nNow, about the movement. Game is fast and so do Champion. But because of default speed being high there's no typical speed running tricks like bunnyhopping. Although rocket jumps are still a thing. Despite of no classic tricks movement is still good and responsive.\nOk, that was the gameplay. Now, graphics and music.\nPersonally... I don't exactly like game's graphics. It uses Unreal Engine 4 so effects, lightning and reflections are really great. And there's a problem. Game is partially using sprites (actually, believe it or not, weapons are sprites) and textures are all pixelated. From time to time game can look great and also can look like a big pile of... Well, you know. While it's an interesting idea IMO it also creates inconsistency. To each his own, I guess. I prefer Dusk's full retro experience at that point. And also, I must say that I really don't like game's font. Again - to each his own and it's just IMO but my eyes are bleed when I see text written with this font. Stylish? Yeah. Practical? No.\nSpeaking of game's sounds - I like them. Especially mace's attacks. Environment, weapons, enemies - can't say that any of this sounds bad. Also, soundtrack. Once again created by Andrew Hulshult. He's a great soundtrack composer, make no mistake. And while soundtrack in Amid Evil is good, it's not the one you would like to listen apart from game. It's not a memorable one.\nSo, what do we have in the end? Would I recommend this game? Actually, yes, go for it. In my opinion it's weaker than Dusk in a lot of aspects, but you should remember that I'm a Quake type of guy, not Heretic. And even with that, I like the game. For now I finished it only once (except final episode which has not been released when review has been written) and probably now my experience will be a little different. I'll try it again. And I would recommend you to try it yourself. It's good, especially when you will find episode that's good for you.", "hours": 9.2, "username": "SiJei", "products": 1300, "early_access": true}

I tried pubg, roe etc.\nSo why are you here? you may ask now. I really like Dying Light, seems simple enough to buy this game.\nThis game is not a 100- or even 50 player BR. 12 go in, 1 comes out. The game starts with you dropping on bags of trash in the slums, where you immeadetly find some buildings with loot in it. The main weapons are melee but a bow is also pretty common as where guns are rare throu' airdrops.\nNow your objective is to loot DNA samples from Hives until you have 1800. There is an ingame level system from 0-5, which you progress by collecting samples. With each level up you gain health and damage.\nWhen someone reaches the 1800 DNA samples, this person will be marked as hunted and their location is visible up to 50m. A helicopter will arrive shortly after collecting the 1800 samples which only the person with the 1800 samples can board. This will force everyone to hunt those with 1800 samples in order to prevent them from boarding and looting their samples by killing them.\nIn terms of graphic, animation etc. Dying Light: Bad Blood is exactly like the original. The only thing that really bugs me are the animations of the melee weapons. This game was designed to be PvE. I exclude the \"Be the Zombie\" mode as you are playing a supernatural Zombie where animations don't weight much. But in a human PvP these animation feel like from 2005. That or the high desync is the real problem as they are no dedicated servers and everyone from eveywhere can join a game.\nI think that's the point where this game can also seperate from the original game. By not also adding more moves but improved melee animations.\nFurthermore, the game has a lot of cosmetics, where the rare stuff can only be aquired by \"Blood Bucks\" which are only obtainable throu real money or rare events ingame. But most of the skins are simply not that good. I don't think that anyone would spend real money to buy some of these skins. The majority feels like low effort and no creativity.\nDespise that, the game IS fun, it IS an early access game which some people tend to forget.\nPlease discuss that stuff with the animations and or the desync in your team. Maybe Iam just wrong and feel off. I just played alot of \"Star Wars: Jedi Academy Movie Battles II\" and I feel like that game from 2003 has better melee animations than Dying Light.\nOverall I really like this game and Iam stoked to see whats coming next.\nGood Night\nGood Luck.", "hours": 7.8, "username": "Revan's heir", "products": 116, "found_helpful": 37, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": true}

I  have 78 hours under my belt and these are my thoughts on this early access game.\nI knew this was a beta and not a finished product so i didnt have dreams of it being a stellar AAA polished game.  But what i have discovered is a real gem of a survival game.\n***  I have played Rust, The Forest, and 7 days to die so naturally my experience with Heat will be affected by my experiences with other early access games of this genre.***\nDISCLAMER:  I have only played PVE servers so i can get  a grip on the game before I jump into the fray on PVP--jess sayin'\nPros.  *All of the mechanics work very well ie. running, chopping gathering, shooting etc.\n*there is a lot of grinding to be done in order to advance with better tools, weapons and tech.  However the grind isnt unnecessarily exaggerated.  Very reasonable and enjoyable in my opinion.\n* there is an innumerable number of things to research, build and collect to exist in this western survival game.\n*  the base building mechanics work well and offer  lots of abilities to create unique buildings with many different material types.\n* In PVE servers people can shoot each other however they cannot loot your corpse  so you never lose anything.  So all those hours getting that cool weapon wont be lost if you get shot in the back.\n* Sound effects are, for the most part, really done well.\n* The graphics are a treat  to the eyes with all the various settings to choose from.\n* The variety of terrain is fairly good from what i have encountered.\n* Lots of natural wildlife to see, hunt and scavenge from.\n* the play mechanic that allows players to compete for president, sheriff, chief etc keeps the action up and competition tight.  Reminds me of GTA5 where players are awarded for  taking out the top guy leaving them to have to defend their newly awarded title.\n* many other pluses which are too numerous to mention.\nNow onto the cons.  there are many slight glitches i have encountered.   no surprise as this is early access.  BUT, none I have encountered have been game breaking or a buzz kill to the game playing experience.\nCons:    * Animal sound effects are completely slathered with weak sauce.\n* All animals attack you.  Ducks, deer, chickens, sheep, bears, wolves etc.  Really?  Killer chickens?   Thats ok, they have them in the game as content and will later program to act accordingly.  Im fine with that.  It is early access after all.\n* There are several \"slight\" bugs concerning item creation.  For example i created a bench today and set it down on a foundation.  I didnt like where it was but I am unable to relocate it.  i can pick up and move all the other dozens of objects Ive made, but not that bench.  Not a deal or game breaker.  It is early access so no biggie.\n* I have had 5 -6 crashes in the entire 70+ hours Ive played.  THAT IS NOT BAD AT ALL.  Considering i am getting 10+ hrs of game play between each crash is very acceptable for early access.\n* The PVE NA server I'm playing on has some clan that actually walled off the ENTIRE area around the whitehouse so you cant enter and contest the position of president.  It's impossible!  The devs may want to look into not allowing players to do so.  Its a buzz kill when you cant  participate in a core objective of the game.\n* My framerate  is very stable (60-90 FPS) but the stuttering and rubber banding is very noticable and at times, irritating.  By rubber banding i mean you are walking only to find yourself 30 feet back where you just were only to have to cover that 30 feet again.  Not a deal breaker but i hope it will be improved in time as this game matures.\n* There are many other cons but for me they are only slight.  So slight in fact that I cannot recall any others but I know there are.\nIdeas for the future:\n* The map has a train that circles the map.  But currently it does nothing other than travel the map.  i would love to see it full of flatbed cars with bandits on it that shoot you as it passes.  If you die perhaps you might lose 10% of your held resources.  Similar in nature to the chopper introduced in Rust a few years back.  Get out of the way, hide, run  or your gonna get killed.  Also, make it possible to get on the train say by dropping down from a bridge above and dukeing it out with the bandits.  If you slay them you can loot their bodies for goodies.\n*  More locations or jobs or objectives that create the desire for players to fight it out and get loot.\nVERDICT:   If this game was only patched to fix the various glitches I've mentioned and others i havent and then finalized I would give it a 3.5.   But since it is early access and offers so much more potential in the months ahead I am very comfortable giving this game in its  current state a solid 4 out of 5.  If you like these sort of games but want to see it more fully fleshed out then put it on your wishlist or follow it.\nI really tip my hat to the devs for their very stable and playable early access title.

If I could give this game a 5/10 the i would do it. But most people rate this game as a good one and i think that it just isn't.\nThe gun design is ♥♥♥♥ing great and this game looks so beautiful. You can tell in which level of the episode you are while most of the levels in the early episodes aren't very distinct. But i just think that the bad enemy placement and overall lack of depth ruins the game for me.\nMost enemys are placed far away from you when they start rushing at you. They are pretty fast so most fights outside of these big arena like fights cosist of you strafing around a horde of enemys chasing after you. And big arena fights are going to be over pretty fastly because of the sould mode that you stacked up before the big fights.\nThe game doesn't really incurage weapon switching since most weapons deal a pretty similar amount of damage and hit well on almost all ranges(even the games shotgun!).\nResource managing also doesn't make any sense because of there only being 4 types of mana for 6 weapons (2 for 4 noormal weapons).\nThere are no puzzles or anything like that. Just simple sequences of buttons to press (which wonders me because i've heard that heretic and hexen had complex puzzles in them)\nThere is no special movement just wasd and jump + rocket jumping doesn't give you any upsides in the game. There are no mechanics that make the gameplay interesitng. No mechanics you could master. There is no depth. No reason to potentially sink in more hours than needed for the campaign into the game.\nThere really isn't anything that makes the levels feel special and alive (except for those of episode 5 which i liked the most since it pulls of alot of the characteristics that i don't like the game for really goodly) except for those texts on the wall that you can only read if you step infront of them ,which are all over the place making them repetetive when they spew out stuff like\n. There is no stuff you can break or switches you can pull or magic stuff that you could do which would fit really goodly in this game. Almost all levels are just pretty facade.\nIdk why but i don't think this game deserves the praise that it gets. It's an ok game. It's no masterpiece. It might be just like hexen and heretic (i haven't played these games) but this doesn't change that Amid evil is a mediocre game. I've only played 5 of the episodes. But that is a majority and I don't think that the game will get any better if the other ones are absolute kickers since the biggest part of the experience was mediocre. Maybe people are just blinded by nostalgia or maybe i just don't get the game. I activated comments so that people can tell me what im doing wrong if im doing something wrong.

At the time I am reviewing this, 6 out of 7 planned episodes are out.\nI kept hearing about the new-age holy trinity of retro fps, the keepers of the old guard: Amid Evil, Dusk and Ion Maiden so naturally I picked them all up not long ago. Now out of all of them this was the one I heard the least about. Dusk is already complete and Ion Maiden made a lot of news being the first official build engine game in many many years.\nAmid Evil , from what I had heard about it was very much like Heretic and Hexen, as much as I (and many others) love those games. They are not as well known as Doom, Duke or quake, which is why this game might fly under many peoples radars, and a big reason I want to review it, it's fantastic and almost everyone who has played it thinks so too, though it still seems relatively hidden!\nThe whole game oozes creativity and \"Extreme\". The level layouts are crazy-neat and original. The art style is unique and takes the eyes time to adjust. See it's 3-D and in the unreal 4 engine but they made it look retro and somewhat pixelated. Some things are a 2-D and a 3-D hybrid. Really weird and unique. Just like DUSK, you can make it look as modern or retro as you like. As advertised it is well optimised. I played this on my \"retro gaming\" pc, which is 6 years old and has no dedicated graphics card just a 1gig VRAM onboard gfx and I played at a lower resolution and the game took resources from the cpu instead, I kept a solid 60 fps except on more hectic battles with♥♥♥♥♥♥flying all over the place I went down to 40-ish.\nIt is easy to compare this to Heretic and Hexen, as far as weapon design  and mana pickups go (green, blue, orange. All weapons use a different type/colour), it is identical though the weapons in this game go a little crazier. There is a lot of enemy variety, more than usual retro fps games, each episode changed the enemy roster almost completely every time. It's fast moving, I would say more like quake than heretic or doom, it can get quite fast in this game.\nThe pacing is much like what you will know, episodes with multiple levels, however this game has less levels per episode. you may be used to 7-10 or something of that nature. AMID EVIL has 4 levels each episode, the 4th one being the boss level (and those are really well done). The levels however are all much bigger, there are many secrets, many different heights and depths to explore, they sprawl quite a bit(keep in mind you are nearly travelling at the speed of sound and they are still huge). The levels look NOTHING alike, each one is hand crafted to an art form.\nThe Music is great, Atmospheric and moody. It is more upbeat on some levels and has it's drone-like moments. Every time a bigger battle comes about the music organically shifts into \"epic mode\". As for difficulty, I played this on medium for the first shot, normally I go for hard or whatever the 2nd hardest mode is so I expected it to maybe be too breezy. I was surprised to be wrong for the most part. The enemy AI is really varied and quite smart and everything goes so fast , it keeps you moving to stay alive. At later levels I quite often found myself begging for a health orb to show up around the next corner.\nAll in All, this was just a real treat to play, hell I didn't even know I wanted to right away, I opened it to test out a level and that was all I played for the next 2-3 days. I was constantly saying WOW! to the level design, art style and music and gameplay all at once. Some of the ways you travel and do platforming in this game is unlike anything I have seen in a game of this genre. I thought to myself : \"The devs must have been doing some crazy good drugs to come up with these really neat ideas and designs\" then I thought that was not doing them proper credit because honestly you would have to be as sober as can be to have such consistently good design choices :P\nApologies for the rant type review, I never write these so I just let the words flow out naturally and it ends up all over the place and disorderly. If you are asking whether you should wait to pick this up, I say \"NO, GET IT NOW\" it is super complete and well done in it's early access state, only one planned episode is missing. besides the episodes, there is an endless Horde mode that gets real intense! After playing I had realised that there is a rather complete list of cheats, and  they get pretty creative and fun! Classic retro shooter, Classic fun.

It's fun, competitive, and balanced.\nPlaying this game really brings out the best parts about Dying Light and makes it into a battle royale. From intense close up hand to hand combat to dodging arrows and bullets from a distance, this game will make any situation fun. Not only that but this is NOT your typical battle royale, there is an objective other than be the last one left. You must collect samples from several simple little trials that test your abilities on all fronts. Combat, parkour and evasiveness. All the trials for samples require you to use one or more of the game's very well crafted mechanics to complete, and it is worth it. With each sample you collect you make progress towards an XP bar that levels you up and makes you all the more deadly to other players. Rather than hiding and waiting until other people kill each other, this game pressures you into running around and doing the dirty work yourself. Beware though, someone with more samples is more likely to win because of the level advantages. But with enough skill, you can eliminate this player and take their samples for yourself.\nThis game is balanced. Well. No matter what you have or have not found you can kill any player. A level 1 player, who has not collected a single sample, can beat a level 5 person easily if skilled enough. The guns you can find are also balanced. They have low ammo counts and require the player to aim well to kill another player. The melee combat is great, if someone finds a heavy axe that can kill you easily, you can parry, block and kick to weaken the player as well as leave yourself opportunities to get in some hits.\nAll in all, I love this game and I look forward to seeing where it goes and what other cool mechanics they add.

What worked so well vs zombies in the PVE game comes off as very disconnected combat in this game.\n- The BR mode itself does not play out with proper building tension and tightening of the arena.  Instead there's just a hard cut off (night time) where the helicopter just leaves without you.\n- The game says it has 15 player limit but whenever more than 7 get in a game several will get disconnected immediately to lower it down to about 4-7 as if the networking cant handle that many players.\n- Due to the small number of players and lack of team modes this game feels really small ; one really dominate player can easily run around the mapin a circle and quickly locate everyone and killt hem quickly.\n- the game gives you a radar telling you where others are. I feel like this ruins part of the game - I shouldn't know where people are and they shouldnt know where I am.  This lets those players mentioned above very easily track you down.\n- finally the game appears to be plagued by cheaters/hacks.  Normally for instance you can not hit someone who is running away as attacking slows you down a bit. Now there is a run speed boost but I just can't beleive this one guy gets it every tiem and runs circles around the map 1-2 shotting people (as he does)  In a BR if there's cheats/hacks then its just not a competetive ground and its ZERO fun when it feels like people are cheating.\nOverall this game needs a lot of work to add up to other BR options on the market.", "hours": 51.2, "username": "doommetal", "products": 341, "found_helpful": 14, "early_access": true}

It does its job of creating a setting and goal for the protagonist of the game and that is about it. But Amid Evil like many of its kind, isn’t a game that you play, for the story, you play it for the gameplay.\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay to Amid Evil is fast-paced, adrenaline-filled action, that not only pays utmost respects to games like Hexen and Heretic but also brings the gameplay not just to a modern audience but to a whole new never before seen level. From the solid combat to the small details of specific yet important sound effects to the fluent and easy to navigate level design. Amid Evil is a game that holds nothing back, and its gameplay is nothing short of spectacular for it.\nLevel Design:\nThe design of the levels is old-school, but it is still as effective today as it was back in the 90s. The levels all feel organic, where you never get confused or feel that the level of design is forcing you down a specific path. They have a natural flow to them that works brilliantly and you instantly know where you have been and where you need to go next. But the level design does suffer from a major difficulty spike with the 5th and 6th episode when compared to episodes 1-4.\nAtmosphere:\nEach and every episode is unique both in design and its atmosphere with a soundtrack that is equally as different and fitting for each. It is a soundtrack that proves Andrew Hulshult is more than capable of making top quality tracks that can still fit in with the atmosphere of the game without them being pure heavy metal. And each and every track he has composed for Amid Evil is fitting and intensifies the experience tenfold.\nConclusion:\nAmid Evil has blown me away. From it’s creative and imaginative design of weapons and enemies, to its incredible level design, magical atmosphere and soundtrack and solid combat, Amid Evil is brilliant in every way. It is the FPS game I have waited over two decades for. This isn’t a game for pansies just because of its medieval fantasy weapons. It is as badass, hardcore and balls deep in blood, guts and gore as any DOOM, Quake, Unreal or DUSK.\nWhat minor issues the game does have are quickly forgiven and forgotten and don’t impact the overall enjoyment of the experience. You don’t need to be a fan of Hexen or Heretic to enjoy Amid Evil. Whether you are a demon-slaying DOOM veteran, a Quake Lovecraftian fanatic or a head-banging cultist slaying Duskdude, it doesn’t matter. Amid Evil has it all and will exceed all expectations. Whether it is while it is still in early access or you wait until version 1.0, if you are a fan of old-school shooters, Amid Evil, is an absolute must play.", "hours": 16.3, "compensation": "Product received for free", "user_id": "76561198082856200", "username": "Shephard", "products": 159, "found_helpful": 10, "early_access": true}

{"product_id": "766370", "page": 7, "page_order": 1, "recommended": true, "date": "2019-01-24", "text": "So, lemme just kick this off with my Early Access TL;DR spiel. If you're interested in this game, don't bother paying for Early Access unless you are DEAD SET on playing this when it exits Early Access and you want those Founders benefits. The game is unfortunately really sparsely populated, usually only meaning four to five players per match instead of the intended twelve. If you want to wait, absolutely, come back when it's free-to-play and in full release. It'll be worth it.\nIn any case. Dying Light: Bad Blood is an absolutely fantastic breath of fresh air in the current Battle Royale craze. It doesn't feel like a sloppy, low-effort cash grab to try and monopolize on the successes of PUBG and Fortnite, and it really shows. The formula to Bad Blood's own take on battle royale is hectic, fast-paced, and damned exciting.\nTwelve players are randomly spawned on different locations on a map, tasked with retrieving blood samples from zombie hives. As soon as the game starts, it's all about running for the nearest weapon to protect yourself with from zombies, scavengers, and players alike. Bows and grenades are decently available, but guns of any kind are incredibly rare and often dangerous to pursue. Using Dying Light's robust melee combat, you have to take out zombie packs defending hives, allowing you to extract the blood samples.\nCollecting blood samples effectively makes you stronger, going through five total levels of power increase that increase your durability and damage output. Hives do come in a number of forms; smaller hives are usually only protected by regular zombies, medium and large hives are often protected by hulking Demolisher zombies that also offer armor for defeating them, and some small hives are even highly mobile Bolter zombies that need to be killed in order to harvest blood samples.\nWhen at least one player has reached Level 5, the extraction helicopter shows up to pull out whoever has enough samples. Level 5 players have their locations telegraphed in real-time to other players still alive, so it becomes a struggle to either reach the helicopter before anyone else can intercept you, wipe out the competition on the way there so you can safely extract with no problems, or get murked by someone else and watch as they take your samples and your victory away from you without mercy.\nBad Blood's biggest strength, for me, is that this feels like something that would naturally pop up as a competitive multiplayer take on Dying Light, even without the Battle Royale craze. Dying Light's mechanics are still very much intact and do surprisingly well with the addition of PvP in what was a PvE story campaign experience in the original game. There's thought put into this, and that's why I love it; it isn't lazy, and there's real effort put into making this a unique take on battle royale.\nHowever, Bad Blood's biggest weakness right now is, unfortunately, a seeming lack of interest. As far as I can find regarding statistics, the game has never peaked a thousand concurrent players at any given time, and the lack of an active playerbase means that matches often start with only four or five players instead of the proper twelve. And with matches being a third of the size of what they're supposed to be, it does artificially create an issue of the map feeling too big, loot being too abundant, and the PvP action being minimal.\nThat said, though, the foundation is here. Server connection is solid, as I've only ever really had one notably laggy game that I can think of. And I have managed to play proper twelve-player games on the rarest of occasions, and they absolutely do bring out just how great Bad Blood promises to be. With the game moving to a free-to-play model upon exiting Early Access, those fleeting moments of perfection I experience in Early Access will become the norm, and at that point, I can recommend the game to anyone without hesitation.\nI know it's in bad taste to sell the promise of something that may never be properly realized, accounting for Murphy's Law. But PLEASE, believe me when I tell you that Bad Blood is a game that will absolutely shine in spades when it goes free-to-play. Twelve-player lobbies on the regular will absolutely make the strengths of the game come to light. And quite frankly, as much as the game's free-to-play future excites me thinking about the possibility of full matches whenever I log in to play instead of the empty servers we have now, I'd honestly think the game could still warrant being at a $20 price tag and being fair for what you get.\nBut unfortunately, until such a time, I can't consciously recommend Bad Blood to anyone that isn't a diehard Dying Light fan and absolutely itching to get their hands on the competitive multiplayer Dying Light experience. Please, for the love of God, come back when it's free-to-play if you don't want to pay that entry fee into the Early Access build, because I guarantee that it'll be worth your time then.", "hours": 1.6, "username": "SerinVeya", "products": 513, "found_helpful": 3, "early_access": true}

But 'Out of Reach' does them better!\nI had been looking for a game like this for a long time - one where strategic fortress design plays a key role in one's survivability against siege weapons and other threats. It's a thoughtfully designed game, for the most part. Unfortunately, the thoughtfulness didn't quite go far enough... Its main flaw is that on the STD and PVP servers, there is no way of knowing who attacked your base when you were offline. So you get players taking revenge on the wrong people. You can spend days building what you think is an almost impenetrable base, only to find someone destroying it, all too easily, because of something they wrongly think you did to them. Result: Many newcomers don't stick around. I mean, why bother to go through all that grind to rebuild, if you can get wiped out so easily? So be prapared for some disheartening setbacks if you enter a STD or PVP server when you are new to the game. And if/when you do decide to try PvP, try and find a server that is not a hopeless situation, i.e. with skilled players ruling the roost and ever looking for 'fresh meat' (like you) to massacre.\nSo what this game needs most, for the PvP servers, IMO, is a log, where we can see who attacked our base, and when, and where their own base is located. And a means of contacting them would be good too. I think this would make the game envisonment more fun and less like a bunch of scorpions in a jar, with everyone distrusting and suspecting everyone else. With a few such tweaks, and a bigger game world, this game would be really excellent. Unfortunately the game is no longer under active development, it seems - which is a real wasted opportunity for the devs.\nIn any case, I think it deserves credit for its depth and innovation including interesting features, such as pilotable sailing ships, lootable shipwrecks, a pilotable glider, and even the option to trade with pirates. The big-game-hunting aspect is well done, with just the right amount of skill and danger entailed.  Unfortunately, the scope for endless hours of fun and discovery is thwarted by the limited size of the game world (just a few islands, that are all easilly reached within 30 minutes of sailing).\nThe base-building system can be very satisfying (once you get the hang of it). The results can look awesome. The stonework and woodwork looks better than in other games of this genre. It gives you great scope for creativity, and that's partly what makes the game great. There are several extensive islands to explore, and all beautifully modelled. I think the graphics are pretty good, and I really like the atmosphere of the Out of Reach world - at least, when I'm not getting attacked for something I didn't do.\nIt's probably a good idea to start out in the relatively safe Single Player (PVE) mode, until you are familiar with the game. There are four server types to choose from: Single-player, PVE, PVP and STD (somewhere in-between PVE and PVP). Just don't expect a large player count, because this game is still largely undiscovered, and those that do discover it often give up very quickly after getting wiped out. Even in the easiest (Single Player) mode, be prepared to die a few times while learning the basic skills.  Experience earns you advantage points which you can spend in various ways to increase your effectiveness.\nSome might be aghast to find 18th century ships, medieval siege weapons and classical age body armour, all in the same game, but I can forgive such quirks if the game is good, and this one is. Games that adhere religiously to historical accuracy are often dull, anyway!\nAt least two of the positive reviewers on Steam said they prefer 'Out of Reach' to 'Rust' (one of the all-time best-selling crafting/survival games). So I can recommend it, especially if the idea of an age of sail survival game with some medieval-style features (and halleluja, no zombies) appeals to you.\n**** Please give my review a thumbs-up if you deem it helpful.

So I'm going to touch a bit on what I think about many of its features. It's a throwback, which is plainly evident from the pixelated enemies, and old-school enclosed level design in which you can see a differently rendered world outside the playable area.\nThe various levels so far are all memorable in their own right, and are based around a common, unifying color scheme to stand out among the other levels' different color schemes. This can, however, leave one with a sense of fatigue if you're in a level too long, making it feel a bit one-note at times. I would personally say this is true for me on the Solar Solstice episode, where half of everything is yellow and the enemies are often a pretty good shade of yellow. However, the aesthetic of the game is oddly satisfying, and you wouldn't expect the low-res pixelated enemy models to work well with the comparatively higher-res levels, or the significantly more hi-res weaponry you run around with, but it somehow just all works, feeding back into the throwback nature of it all. The level design itself is fantastic, with some levels featuring open verticality and flying enemies to challenge you, and the map design itself being a potential challenger to your progress, so not only does your combat skill have to improve to continue, but so too does your ability to traverse the landscape, often simultaneously. Visually it's appealing to the eye, and the level design alone gives you a good idea about the kind of people that would have created the places before their corruption, from the fanatical obsessions of suns and moons by their respective cults to the wide open and almost flauntingly large forges. In addition, secrets abound: I will fully admit I cannot find many of the secrets in the game. I learned you can use the planet launcher weapon to basically grenade jump, but more often than not I ended up hurting myself trying to go for suspected secret areas only to turn up nothing, so secrets they are.\nThe music is hit or miss, and I'm somebody who loves game soundtracks. For me, I am having trouble remembering any of the level tracks, and while combat brings about a more action-y feeling to the music, I can't say that it's what ever got my blood pumping compared to the actual combat. To its credit, when I'm actually playing the game, the ambience is definitely aided by the music, so it's not a pointless aspect, I just can't seem to ever recall any of it as soon as the game closes.\nBut the combat is where the real meat and potatoes of the game lies, and it is good. Combat is fast, and the weapons feel good. You get a melee axe, and you can just plain hear the power when you smack something. The arcane staff you get doesn't feel impactful, but the value of not having to aim completely in a game like this can feel invaluable at times. The Voltride(sic?) is just amazing: an electric trident that has a chain lightning effect if you keep zapping a dead enemy for an Overkill, that's just great. The Star of Torment though, that's my favorite. Is it the best? I don't know, I don't care, but flinging a spiked mace that sends out its spikes in a shotgun fashion and will pin dead enemies to walls behind them is just so satisfying to use. There's also a Soul Power system to empower your weapons to ludicrous levels.\nI do have a nitpick however: The font they use in-game is kind of atrocious. Stylistically it fits the game, but in terms of readability, it's really bad. Some letters look a lot like numbers, and some numbers can look like other numbers. I have to actively read what I'm looking at, which makes it a pain to tell at a glance what my HP is at at some points, as well as ammo. In addition, you have writing on the walls which can act as lore tidbits, but this is in that same font so it takes longer to read the short messages than it rightly should. While I have come across some trouble fonts in games before, I was never able to acclimate to this one so that I could read it quickly at a glance, so it stayed a problem. This isn't a big deal on menus, since you can take your sweet time, but for HUD information, it's a big deal. If they kept the same style and overall size but made the actual characters thinner, it would likely be significantly more readable at a glance.\nThe game is great as far as I can tell. If the biggest complaint I can conjure about a game is that I can't remember the music after closing the game while it works well enough in-game and that your font is too thick as to make some letters and numbers look too similar, I'd say it's pretty good.", "hours": 154.9, "user_id": "76561198000630112", "username": "No, your kid is not cute", "products": 239, "found_helpful": 3, "early_access": true}
{"product_id": "673130", "page": 8, "page_order": 4, "recommended": true, "date": "2019-03-14", "text": "An authentic and fun retro-style FPS. The devs have done a great job adapting both retro gameplay and aesthetics to 21st-century tech. There is clearly a lot of care and attention put into the art of the game. Enemy models are more high-poly than eg. Quake, but still look retro, and are very well-animated. They even have some distinct death animations depending on what weapon they're killed by. Every enemy serves a specific role, and poses a significant threat. In earlier versions they mostly just bum-rushed the player, but now they act more intelligently and are much more fun to fight. As for weapons, you get 7, all of which are very distinct and quite satisfying to use - even the melee option and pistol-equivalent staff. After killing enough enemies, \"soul mode\" is activated, in which each weapon uses a more powerful alternate fire. To succeed, you'll need to learn the proper usage of each weapon (both normal and soul, as they can be quite different). Soul mode, although obviously inspired by Heretic's Tome Of Power, is implemented a bit differently. It unlocks automatically when you get enough souls, but only activates when you actually press fire. The textures are low-res and unfiltered, but look great. The levels are low-poly by modern standards, but much more grand and open than in actual retro games. And they look GORGEOUS. The architecture and lighting are nothing short of eye candy. And every episode has a distinct architectural / visual style, as well as its own set of enemies. My favorites are episode 3's ancient complexes full of water passages and episode 4's sun-themed temples.  It is somewhat unfortunate that your time with certain enemies is so limited, but it keeps the game from getting at all stale, since you have to adapt new tactics in every episode. My least favorite is episode 5 (The Forges). There are too many instant death pits and environmental hazards, which makes the gameplay difficult in the worst way and encourages savescumming. Episode 6 suffers from this a bit as well, with all of its thin winding walkways suspended high in the air. The problem is this game has NO railing anywhere. So if you make a wrong step (usually trying to dodge an enemy) on these walkways, you'll fall either to your death or to a spot way earlier in the level. This is easily the biggest cause of frustration in the game. But besides that issue, the level design is really good. Everything flows perfectly - there's never a chance to get lost, but it also doesn't feel overly linear. Levels are interconnected and loop around, with backtracking minimized by clever shortcuts. I would recommend this to any fan of retro FPS games.\nI hope the devs implement deathmatch and release a level editor, because those would GREATLY increase the game's replayability / longevity. I can imagine having a lot of fun hacking friends to bits with the axe in multiplayer.", "hours": 14.7, "user_id": "76561198859993143", "username": "whirledtsar", "products": 5, "early_access": true}

It's still relatively new, and the Devs undeniably listen and care, so, that, along with the reasonable price, is what pushes it to a \"yes.\"  Seems best for multiplayer, especially if you can get friends playing or find a decent faction to join.  A single person in multiplayer seems pretty screwed, though, HAVE TO log in regularly or bases go abandoned in days, and cannot do battle on boats (need a driver and at least one gunner to fire at all).\nOverall, it is fun and challenging, and how long the single-player can be is up to what all you want to build and how completely you explore (there are a few caves/mines, too).  Sadly, fighting pirates in ships is not really an option by yourself (they don't board, just sink with cannon), and no AI attacks bases, so the challenges are avoiding hostile boats, killing them on land (pirates respawn in ruins as soon as you leave), animals (some are remarkably fierce), and getting the stuff to build up equipment, bases & whatnot.  I also never found the piers or paddleboats I saw in so many screenshots, or any mods or anything to get them.  I'd hoped that maybe the plans were in treasure chests, but, so far, no luck...\nThe combat is a bit clunky, especially melee (best to work up bow, arrows & bowmanship), and there is no storyline.  The quests are like a tutorial, but, there are lots of treasure maps and shipwrecks.  The gliders could be more fun, too, but, building a ridiculously high tower to launch from (preferably on a mountain) helps.\nThere is also NO pause, even in single player, that's where bases come in handy most (other than smelting & smithing - I built tons of small cabins all over to duck into for a moment, rather than logging all the way out every time life interrupted).", "hours": 56.6, "username": "Grok the Semisane", "products": 101, "found_helpful": 23, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": false}

But I took a gamble and thought that these guys could not work so hard to keep their 2nd place position in the top 10 SCAMMERS of indie survival game devs.\nI was wrong. At this point in time, it is obvious they did not make enough profit with all their bad reputation and did not sell as many copies as they would have liked to. Truth is, they're just 3 nerds. That never grew up. That never had a vision for the games they were making. That do not know how to make a title a success. They took Reign of Kings framework and the money from RoK to make a similar game in a western setting. While people were buying RoK they were taking the money and investing it in this thing without letting anyone know they were abandonning RoK. It's the same deal here. The money you put in this is not going in this game.\nBut they have the exact same approach as the two other titles they've worked on. The first two months they were very active, patching almost daily. Giving the impression it mattered to them to save what was little left of their reputation. But lately, they are back to their old ways. Not communicating at all what is going on. Fixing bugs and tweaking mechanics. That is it. As time will pass, there will be less and less patches. And they will release it as empty as it is.\nEMPTY PLACEHOLDER GAME: If you buy this, expect no new content at all until it is released. You buy it and that is all it will always be. AI NPCs are broken, VoiP is broken, animals AI is stupid. There is no vendors in towns. No reason to go anywhere on the map. The train is a prop you cannot interact with, except getting killed by it. And the population is so low, even on official servers, that you're wasting your time expecting to meet anyone.\nI gave them a chance, but strike 3 you're out Codehatch. You've been able to sell another empty abandonware, that you will consider a finished product and have about 10 fanbois to say it's the greatest thing ever made.

{"product_id": "656240", "page": 10, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2019-04-12", "text": "So I'll start this off by saying I was very hesitant to purchase this Initially. Having played and thoroughly enjoyed the developers previous game (which is basically this game reskinned with a bit of reworking) I was interested to see what they were going to do. I came into it with an open mind, trying to put behind my the saltyness that came from the cheaters and overall leaving the game to die that the developers had done last time.\nI want to say this. If you enjoyed Reign of Kings, minus the cheaters, and you're into the wild west at all, then I would recommend the game. Even in its current state you can have a great amount of fun even if you're solo. However if you're solo I recommend finding a populated server otherwise the entire experience can be a bit dry. People make the experience, the good the bad and the ugly.\nPro's\n- You can play Harvest Moon if you want to. Find a PVE server and start a farm, sell your veg in the shipping bin and raise a family and some animals.\n- If you have a good computer the game runs fine, with the exception of the start up load time. It is EA afterall.\n- Depending on how you want to play, you can quite honestly do what you want and be what you want. You just need to find the appropriate server(PVE, PVP, RP). You want to rob people on your horse? Do it. You want to tax the land and ride around on your bear messing with people? Go ahead, see how far it gets you. Play the good guy or the villain.\n- So far the updates have been decent(though less often than I hope), and have improved issues rather then jam more crap in.\nCons\n- Random load screens(short but noticeable) as you're travelling across the land\n- The train is useless at this point. I get that it looks cool but why have it running the track if you can't catch it at the train stations that look like you should be able to catch a train there. It's more annoying checking your map to see if its sneaking up on you while you're picking cotton along the tracks then it is beneficial or cool.\n- The grind is a bit slow. There are some servers that have higher harvest rates but the level grinds are still a bit slow, and you can spend a lot of time grinding resources to research, then build the appropriate stations to craft things early on if you're solo.\n- The NPC's don't really feel all that well fleshed out. I'm sure that will change with time but they don't really add much to the game at this point. Like the train, they feel more like they're just there till something better gets done to them. Which I suppose is fair, it would be majorly empty with no NPC's or train on a slow server.\n- Lag. While I've not experienced much of it myself, it seems to be a lot of people have issues with it, so I figured I should mention it.\nOverall I have a lot of fun playing this game. I haven't put a crazy amount of time into it, but I have split most of that time between PVP and PVE/RP servers and personally prefer, and wouldn't mind starting my own PVE/RP server. Most of the folks that join them are actually interested in RP and it adds a nice feeling to the game. There are also PVP servers that do offer RP, but I have less experience in those than the straight PVP.\nIf you enjoyed Reign of Kings while it was good, you'll enjoy this game as they're almost identical in scope and play. I'd recommend starting off an a PVP/RP or a PVE/RP server as the straight PVP can be vicious, and if you're just learning you really need a few hours to kind of catch on, and get a decent start up.\nOverall if you're interested in Early Access games, and you're willing to take a risk that these Dev's might leave the game in a year or so, I don't think you'd do yourself wrong by buying the game and helping the player count!", "hours": 93.6, "username": "Killerdude", "products": 147, "found_helpful": 15, "found_funny": 15, "early_access": true}

They're interesting enough and the overkills and soul modes add interesting variety to combat.\nLevel design is fine.  It's not the best. It's not the worst.  It's certainly not bad, but it's not anything extraordinary.\nSound design is fine.\nEnemy design is where the game somewhat shines.  There's lots of variety, every episode has a completely different set, and some react in cool ways.  Most, however, shoot to where you are standing, so strafing makes this game extremely easy (since enemy count is also low).  Most die very quickly and don't do a lot of damage.\nWhich leads to my final point - the game is easy as hell.  I played on hard and with exception of the forge episode (which was insanely hard and the only episode I died repeatedly, let alone at all) I constantly had max health and max ammo.  In the Mayan episode I had so much ammo that I just ended up spamming the purple mana weapon (BFG).  The solar defender boss dude, who is in the trailers, went down in 10 seconds flat with soul mode + holding left click with weapon 6 (homing bolts that do amazing damage).  I saw him do three attacks and that was it.\nThe game desperately needs its difficulty adjusted.  The enemies (with exception of the tower in the solar episode) are few, die quickly, do little damage (outside the forge), and there's FAR too much health and ammo (increase enemy health and damage or lower health/mana spawns.  Preferably the first, the second leads to boring fights).  Without the risk of the death the game becomes a monotonous chore where I use weapon 6, kill every enemy in 1-2 shots, and just mindlessly plow forward.  Oh look, a large monster?  Pull out weapon 5 and they're down in <5 shots.  Enemies are also stunned frequently when taking damage, making it even easier.  The large sword guys in the solar episode take AGES to wind up their attacks.\nIf the difficulty was hard I would've loved the game.  It's different enough that I could've enjoyed it.  Instead, it was just a mostly mindless slog because it didn't take hardly any attention to get through anything (again, outside the forge).\nIf you increase enemy counts, increase their damage (and unique ways to do damage instead of walking directly towards the player, shooting directly towards the player, or significantly decrease their wind up time in attacking), and increase their health, I'll play it again.

Each weapon in Amid Evil is so well designed, that there really is no weak weapon, except for the starting axe, which is really supposed to be weak. Amid Evil is crazy fun to play and the amount of content packed into such a low price tag puts AAA to shame. It runs great, looks amazing, and is mechanically full of depth.

The mechanics are easy and fun to use once you get used to them. The button mapping was a little confusing for me but once you sort everything how you want it, slicing up your enemies and throwing your utilities becomes a lot more easier. I play Dying Light + the DLCs on Xbox, so I sometimes plug my controller in and it still feels like the game I fell in love with over three years ago, but playing on both controller AND keyboard/mouse is very simple. Here is a list of my pros and cons:\nPros:\n- Parkour (simple, yet elegant and very fast-paced, yet flows beautifully)\n- Weapons (easy-to-learn damage outputs, rare guns do great damage, bows are only for the skilled of players)\n- Upgrades (your weapon does more damage, you can upgrade your bow for great long range kills)\n- Utilities (shields are amazing, medkits are good, land mines are great traps)\n- Parry/Kick - (I love the rock paper scissors element they put in this game: parry > attack, kick > parry - you should practice with a friend and soon predicting enemies will have great reward in-game)\n- Environment (beautifully crafted environment with amazing foliage and stunning graphics: the map is from the original game, yet it feels so new and original)\n- Graphics/FPS (just make sure you have the minimum system requirements or ellse your game will crash, a LOT)\nCons:\n- Guns (shotguns do too much damage, and pistols do not get enough ammo)\n- Dropkick (does barely any damage and does not knock players back that much, ZOMBIES on the other hand...)\n- Computer not good = game constantly crashes (changing graphics quality does nothing, you must have a good graphics card and a good processor)\nOverall 10/10: Techland is still providing new content for us and I went easier on them since it's still in Early Access. This is definitely the BEST battle royale created so far, because of it's originality, mechanics, and beautiful environment (I've played Ring of Elysium and Fortnite, fight me if you think they are better than this).", "hours": 19.9, "user_id": "76561198124228300", "username": "thebillysam_YT [blw.tf]", "products": 14, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

I've played most of the survival/open world game, and this one is unique. The forest are insanely well detailled and beautifull. The shipping bin is a great idea you can literally sell everything from anywhere and buy all you need for a godd start.The skill tree/blue prints  is brilliant, well designed and there is so much to unlock! Crafting stations (all upgradable), weapons, tools, chemistry, farming, clothes, furnitures etc... a ton of items usefull for most of them, good to improve your quality of life and trade or start a business or going to war against the neighbor. I also love the game mechanics, everything make sense and I love all the little details! Hunting a bear with a lever action rifle give me the impression to be  Di caprio in the Revenant, chopping trees is a pleasure when you are able to craft a good bad♥♥♥♥♥axe, and mining is addicting since its gonna make you rich. The money system is great btw!\nSo yes lot of ppl complain because of your past blablabla, I've played +250hrs  for $20 whatever happen I'll still be respectfull. Graphics are great, I've a mid tier computer and the game turn great, there is a lot of settings to configure to have a ok/smooth fps. You guys made great updates and the raid system is and will be one of the more interesting in the market.\nAnyway, my only concern at the moment is the lack of players! they will come im sure but few ideas;)\n-Most of the ppl don't have a lot of time to play so most of them can't access mid tier and end game content! So why give server owner/community a possibility to manage the xp gain? x2, x4, x6  like in almost all survival game. Don't get me wrong I like it how it is, and I can't stand how easy it is to build everything in 2hrs in the other farwest game...\n-The map is big and good looking for most of it, I would like a more enjoyable west cost! Common it's just dry trees for now. Towns are well detailled and good looking but we need interactions with npcs and a reason to go there, other than take the seat of power. If you guys manage to authorize player to claim/flag a town house (like a square but just the house) and be able to use it like a house/shop, it would be amazing for rp/pve/pvp purpose... Or at least put some npc shop owners we can deal/trade with.\n-Its pretty annoying to start always in the same area, the train could be a good way to fast travel...\n-The last but not the least, Common we are in the 21th century!! I know you are working hard on the game and your job is not supposed to be a social media community manager! But can't you find a nice intern to give more life to the community hub??? It would be a great plus to attract people, and would be appreciated by the player base.\nWell, that was my first review and certainly the last. But this game is already a great game if you take time to understand how it works, and the potential is enormous! I love playing video game, like everyone reading this review, in my opinion players should be a little more aware than we need devs like you, taking some risks to improve our quality of gameplay whatever hatters will say... Because what came from your brain give most of us dreams and fun times, and the concept/idea you've created will contribute to ad better survival mechanics/ideas in all survival/open world game. So keep up the good work and congrats: what you did here is stunning!! cheers!", "hours": 637.7, "user_id": "76561198045182576", "username": "azertyuio", "products": 53, "found_helpful": 8, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

Each episode consists of 3 (relatively long) levels and a boss level at the end, and every single one of them boasts its own theme and roster of enemies to unload your weapons on. Speaking of weapons, they're blast to use, ranging from a magic mace that nails enemies to walls, to a staff that fires PLANETS as projectiles, and collecting enough souls from fallen enemies (a la Painkiller) powers them up for ridiculously powerful alternate firing modes (similar to using a Tome of Power in Heretic). Visually, this game is simply put, spectacular; combining modern light effects thanks to the Unreal 4 engine with low-res textures and sprites for an unique look.

Hablando de las armas, son muy divertidas de usar, y van desde una maza mágica que clava a los enemigos a la pared hasta un bastón que usa PLANETAS como proyectiles, y recoger suficientes almas de enemigos caídos (como en Painkiller) activa un modo especial que les da formas de disparo alternativa ridículamente poderosas (algo parecido a usar un Tomo de Poder en el Heretic).

Then because the game crashed, but somehow kept running, my playing time increased to over 2 hours, so no more refund and i'm glad I didn't refund it. I bought this 2 or 3 days ago and already played it for 21 hours. :) I've only played it solo for now. It has some aspects that need work, it needs more content (mainly more and larger ships), but this could eventually become the open-world Blackwake I've been hoping for. For now I'm really enjoying it alot, but ofcourse I don't know if it'll keep my interest for more than 50 hours. Maybe multiplayer will.\nI don't know why it's getting so many negative reviews, maybe that is because I only got it after full release and haven't seen the evolution of the game and/or I don't know what was promised or expected. With more content this could become a great Age of Sail open world survival game (and the only one afaik). A bit what Hearts of Oak was supposed to become, but that was cancelled unfortunately. I wish these devs would cooperate with the makers of HoO for sailing mechanics and Blackwake for the shipmodels.\n-EDIT: I see people complain about the fact few people play multiplayer. If multiplayer if anything like singleplayer, then the only thing multiplayer needs in orde to be fun is more people. Giving negative reviews because multiplayer has too few people is a bit silly and counterproductive, no?\nEDIT2: I've tried (PvE) multiplayer now and have experienced 2-3 gamebreaking bugs that didn't happen in singleplayer. Couldn't unequip a weapon and it seemingly disappeared. Lighting in 3rd person remained dark as in cave, even outside of caves. Logging out and in (30 seconds) fixed all of these.\nIf you enjoy the ship models from the Advanced rafts mod for Ark, and PVE, you will probably love this game.\nPro's:\n- GTA style climbing with spacebar : it isn'talways clear what u can climb, but I really love this, no super high jumping to \"climb\", like in most survival games.\n- Sailing boat with nice details like lantarn, mooring, placable (and removable) cannons, ballista turret on front. You can also climb on the boat from water (unlike the raft in Ark which u teleport onto by pressing E, you can also look in a different direction than where you're sailing unlike in Ark :p)\n- Building hotbar with 7 tabs, makes building alot easier than in any of the competitor's games.\n- Interesting, actually dark caves (not lit like in Ark) to explore and mine ores. Especially the water cave which u can enter with your boat is nice.\n- Graphics are less pretty and shiny than Ark, but makes it feel more real somehow, more like rust and Blackwake perhaps.\n- Many NPC bases to raid of different sizes. A bit difficult solo, but doable if you hide behind walls and take enough bandages. I killed 5 npcs in the camp opposite the starting point by climbing on top of the ruin above them.\n- Treasure hunting and crashed ships to eplore\nCons:\n- No first person sailing. I played in first person the whole time for great immersion, then when I finally built a sailboat it switches to 3rd person ...\n- Only one small sailing boat, there are brigs and galleons in teh game but they are for hostile npcs and trader respectively? Would be great if it had ships like Blackwake does. Needs much more and larger ships , with full interiors. Also rowboats would be cool.\n- Fighting brigs solo is impossible afaik. Some npc followers/crewmembers would be nice for singleplayer.\n- Weird bow and crossbow controls. I would prefer RMB to aim and LMB to fire, and releasing RMB to cancel shot. Or LMB to draw and zoom, and RMB to release. MMB to release is impracal.\n- A bit weird sounds and animations (rain, running)\n- Only one respawn location\n- Inventory could add some quality of life improvements: f.e. two stacks that would add up to more than 200 cannot be joined to make one stack of 200 + a stack of what remains.\n- Flintlock pistols can only be bought from the galleon, not crafted, there are alos no muskets available. All (or most) npcs have firearms, while you are stuck with bows/crossbows untill u can buy a pistol and enough bullets.\n- Had a crash the second time I tried loading singleplayer.

You don't receive any rewards but you're learning the ropes and I appreciated it a lot.\nI have to agree that at some point you may start to lack motivation to continue playing because there aren't many different things to do anymore (in singleplayer) but I switched to building mode at that time and realized some crazy architecture which made me enjoy the game for a couple more hours.\nIn my opinion the game is well worth the asking price of 15 € or even less on sale for the singleplayer alone. There is enough content at this time to get your money's worth. You shouldn't expect high end graphics but you also shouldn't expect these for such a low price, either.\nIt seems like the game is also still being fixed and developed further after full release despite the bad reviews which I believe is a good sign to put faith into the devs and the future of the game.\nI think the most needed improvements are even more crafting options/parts - especially for base building and additional vehicles/boats because I really enjoyed investing my time into crafting \"castles\", towers etc. and would love to build a huge boat for example (currently there is only one pre-defined boat).\nAlso some sort of story or other reasons to explore the world more would be nice.\nMaybe more advanced (NPC) trading features would introduce more things to do or achieve (currently you can only search for treasure or raid pirate camps to \"earn\" currency to trade with one NPC).\nAnd finally NPC and animal animations could use an upgrade/overhaul. The pirate trader lady just looks/\"acts\" like a mannequin which really kills immersion to be honest.\nSo, I hope the game will see further development in the future.\nI'll keep it installed to notice updates and maybe check it out once more at a later time.\nP.S.: I also really love the start menu theme song! :-)", "hours": 22.9, "username": "GeneEric", "products": 2449, "found_helpful": 76, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": false}

{"product_id": "673130", "page": 14, "page_order": 8, "recommended": true, "date": "2019-01-13", "text": "AMID EVIL is a must play for anyone who is a fan of old school FPS.  The controls are tight and responsive, the level design is exceptional with plenty of traps and secrets about (never feeling unfair mind you, the graphics are a very interesting blend of retro meets modern, the value is exceptional (even with only 5 of the 7 planned episodes available), and the polish and lack of bugs puts plenty of \"finished\" games to shame.\nAMID EVIL is an FPS in the vein of your favorite 90's classics.  It's mainly inspired by Heretic & Hexen, as is clearly evident in its visuals, but takes cues from a few others.  For example, it has a set of portals for difficulty selection similar to Quake 1, and its arsenal of 7 weapons most closely resembles DOOM.  It has a feature called Soul Mode, where you collect souls from defeated enemies to fill a meter which activates weapon damage buffs.  Think of rage mode from the God of War games.  Outside of this, it doesn't do much to change the formula of the aforementioned 90's shooters, not that this is a bad thing.  If you like key hunting, secret searching, and fast paced shooting against an interesting and varied set of enemies and bosses, you're bound to enjoy this.\nSpecial praise is deserved for the \"feel\" of the shooting mechanics.  I've played a lot of shooters over the years, and quite frankly AMID EVIL is among the best as far as satisfying combat.  Ducking and weaving to avoid enemy attacks feels incredibly satisfying.  More importantly though, the weapons feel amazing to use and the enemies' death animations are top notch.  Cutting an enemy in half with the Whisper's Edge or pinning an enemy to a wall (or sending the thing flying 100's of feet) witht the Star of Torment never feels old.  This goes doubly for Soul Mode, where even the basic axe is spun around like a boat propeller to grind enemies to pieces.\nThe graphics are mainly inspired by Heretic and Hexen, with fantasy mage-like weapons and enemies.  That's not to say it doesn't have its own look though.  All of the weapons are normal mapped sprites; this results in them looking artistically similar to something you'd see out of Heretic/Hexen, albeit much higher resolution and more detailed.  The models and meshes for enemies and enviornments on the other hand are low polygon 3D models, which more closely resembles Quake.  Finally, the textures are much more detailed than anything you'd see out of any 90's game, although they can't compete with those in modern day \"AAA\" games (and aren't intended to).  There's also a post processing filter that gives everything thick, black outlines and creates a lot of noise to the visuals.  This may not be to everyone's taste, but I think it can be turned down in the options; I personally like it a lot.  While it sounds like a strange amalgamation of art styles and rendering techniques, somehow it ends up feeling very cohesive and works very well.  The soundtrack by Andrew Hulshult (also worked on Rise of the Triad 2013, DOOM Metal soundtrack for Brutal DOOM mod, Dusk) is great, and fits each of the areas incredibly well.\nThe questions I ask to myself when I'm considering buying an Early Access game (a rare occurance on its own) are: is the game in a playable state, and do I get my money's worth in the game's current build.  The answer to both is a resounding yes.  The developers have ensured Early Access is intended for players to give feedback on the nuances of the mechanics, not to QA test a buggy, non functioning pre-alpha.  Over the course of Early Access, the changes have included things such as: adding new episodes, increasing player movement speed, tweaking AI to vary their tactics, and QOL adjustments such as a seperate key bind to activate Soul Mode.  As previously mentioned, there is currently 5 of 7 planned episodes available, with episode 6 being available as a beta branch (which I have not tried).  Each episode takes place in a different world, featuring different aesthetics and enemies.  Each episode has 4 levels available, with the last one being a boss fight in all cases.  While it took me 17 hours to complete all 5 episodes, I really took my time to explore and find all the secrets, so your milage may vary.  There is also an endless, wave based  PvE mode called Hordes of Evil, but I have not tried this yet.  Overall, I felt the $20 asking price was more than fair.\nRunning the game at 1440p with max settings, the never dipped below 100 fps, and could go above 200 at times.  I experienced no outlying performance issues such as stuttering.  While the game did crash twice in my 17 hours of play, in both cases I had an HD Youtube video playing on my second monitor.  My GPU was also overclocked, which could have contributed to instability.  I can't be certain, but I think the crashing was a result of these external factors, not the game itself.  I experienced no bugs or glitches.  My system specs are:\nGeForce GTX 1080\ni7 4790K at 4.5GHz\n16GB DDR3 @ 2400MHz (dual channel configuration)\nGame installed on a SATA based SSD\nThere really aren't any glaring flaws that I can think of.  If I wanted to get nit picky, the lack of secret levels may dissappoint some who liked this in other games of the genre.  The fact that there are only 4 levels per episode means that you don't get to spend a huge amount of time in any single area.  This is something that could be alleviated with a level editor, although this is currently not planned to my knowledge.  I only mention this as a suggestion to the devs for post-launch content, as I think it would greatly expand the life of the game.  These are only minor gripes though, and don't take away from the fact that what's on offer here is absolutely top notch\nIf I haven't made it clear already, AMID EVIL is an incredible game that I'd recommend to any fan of FPS.  It's a very polished product made by developers that clearly care about the game they're making.  Great level design, fantastic movement and shooting mechanics, weapon and enemy variety, stylistic visual that creatively blend old and new, tons of polish, and more than enough content for the asking price are some of the standout features of AMID EVIL.  I couldn't recommend the game more, and it would be great to see it succeed in an industry where microtransaction driven greed and buggy pieces of crap are all too often rewarded.", "hours": 21.7, "user_id": "76561197980653190", "username": "DrearierSpider", "products": 533, "found_helpful": 2, "early_access": true}

The graphics are interesting, using pixelated textures and low poly models but with some modern touches such as enhanced lighting and reflections.

If we talking about battle royale offcourse we need to kill every single person in the game and be the last man standing, but in Dying light bad blood you will need to collect blood sample,the blood sample it self is defended by other zombie, you might want to bring explosive to POP zombie around it, or maybe do a classic style by killing the zombie with melle weapon. and yeah you need to collect more sample until you hit level 5, collecting it by taking a sample or kill other player that has alredy take sample, then once you or some one hit level 5 extraction is welcome for you or some one, and if it turns out it was not you... YOU SHALL KILL THEM, and you win... melle weapon in this game is unique for example parry some one that want to hit you, death from above,throw your weapon and more, but since Techland fix/tweak ranged weapon the game feels more balance, even its hard to find a pistol,bow,shotgun. (-) The bad side about this game is not much change from the original game they use same mod from the Dying light and change it a bit, same like animation it change a bit but some of the animation is cool & brutal, It kindda repetitive if you keep playing it the map isnt that big and not much to explore, but yeah this game force you to move as fast as you can because THERE IS NO TIME TO WASTE.

They are toking some good stuff cause longest I have waited is like 5-10 mins to go from 1-12 players. And I'm taking weekday mornings in Eastern Time Zone.  The matchmaking is actually kind of cool in that your put into a lobby practice map with all the weapons in the game with infinite respawns to practice with other players. Also people complaining about frame drops need to upgrade their shitboxes cause I have had zero.\nSo far quite like the PvP combat, how it rewards good parkour skills with the ability to escape to come back with a vengeance. It's not as simple as waiting for the opponent to parry or swing, items keep the combat interesting. Some of the items you can quickly use in combat include throwing axes, molotov cocktails, hand grenades (which you can cook to get players). Can also throw back pain killers to heal quickly while in combat. Effective use of items is huge.\nThe PVE aspect comes secondary to the PvP cause your taking damage fighting the NPCs for the competing players. If a player kills you they get all the resource you've collected as part of the PVE. There is an in-battle level up system that fully heals you and also improves your stats for the rest of the match. If your good at avoiding players and gather enough resource you can get to a high level and stand a good chance against more skilled players, at least if their below your level.\nAs a result alot of players just wait around for other players to try and scavenge the hives, and when the weakened target player finishes killing the NPC guardians surrounding the resource, prepare to get ambushed by a vulture player.

It is the difference between enjoyment or disapointment.\nIf you approach this game from co-op pvp you will be let down. You can pvp but there are other games that do it better.\nIf you approach the game from a single player perspective with the side option of pvp should you want it, then I think the\ngame really shines. That being said, I don't pvp for this game but as a single player building/construction/explore game, it's\nquite fun and well made.\nHere are the pros for me\n1. The crafting is nice\n2. Some nice leveling trees\n3. The house building options and shapes are really nice. Some things seem original like volcanite building.\n4. It's not extremely hard but it is challenging giving a sense of accomplishment\n5. Unique approaches such as gliders\n6. The sailboat actually handles nice and is fun\n7. Massive pro - A massive massive map to explore. Islands everywhere and nothing feels random generated.\n8. The graphics are really nice and actually give the feeling of the tropics\n9. A really fun sense of exploration and it feels rewarding.\n10. There are npc pirates and their hangouts. You don't feel alone playing single player. Be warned, they have pistols so\nonly consider attacking their little hangouts well down the road after you are very well equipped. It's a huge risk.\nCons for me\n1. Single player does not let you pause the game. DONT go afk for a long time or you'll starve\n2. If you die your bag will eventually disappear. I don't know the time but afk and dying will probably lose your things.\n3. If you die with your bag expansion on your back, upon retrieving your stuff, items in the main bag remain but items\nthat were in the expansion bag will be gone. In other words, only use your expansion for crappy easy to replace items.\n4. They say its there but getting back on your sailboat while being in the water doesn't work. Get out of your boat near\nrocks or the shore or a dock otherwise you'll never get back in.\nI think this game has gotten a pile of bad reviews because most people come in expecting a real polished pvp experience.\nExample Grim Dawn is a fantastic game with high ratings across the board. The option to be multiplayer is purely secondary. If they had announced the game as a multiplayer then the ratings would be bad.

Less challenging overall than Dusk, with a more Hexen/Unreal inspired feeling. Expect fantasy weapons, ancient celestial cults, and foes such as possessed statues and floating stone heads.\nPros:\n- Tight aiming and movement get you comfortable quickly, although the fluidity of your movements can result in a sloppy feel during a boss or in space constrained fights.\n- A retro artstyle done right, and which can be made quite comfortable to modern sensitivies if you want to turn off all the 90s effects. You'll be wandering through ancient temples and crypts for the most part, but each episode has it's own theme within the storyline.\n- A good weapon selection with each more or less having it's place. Additional weapon variety comes into play from a boost mode of sorts you reach by collecting enemy souls. This normally makes the main effect of the weapon more pronounced and boosts damage, allowing one to really rip through even boss level targets.\n- A wide enemy variety, prevented from becoming overwhelming by using unique enemies per episode. This allows a plentitude of different types of enemy units as well as some overlap without conflict - just as each set of opponents becomes a bit too easy to deal with, a new episode and new tactics await.\n- Interesting levels with good thematic designs.\n- 5 episodes at 30-60 mins each, depending on your play speed per level. Decent amount of replayability due to secrets and par times for speed runs. New episodes on the way - but it's good bang for buck already, especially since it's not filled with unenjoyable busywork or lengthy cutscenes.\n- Stable and performs well.\n- Cheat codes! Fine in a single player game as an alternative way to play the game, although I've mostly restricted it to palette swaps (AE1989 is my favourite)\n- The puzzles in Amid Evil are a good compromise, with more emphasis on combat obstacles during the solving process than overly complex puzzles.\nNeutrals:\n- Challenge isn't all that great, you shouldn't feel frustrated enough even on the harder difficulties that cheats become necessary. No mistake, Amid Evil has it's moments of challenge and you'll die now and then, but overall it's a step down from Dusk in this regard.\n- Weapons feels a little unsatisfying at times, although the enemy variety and map design often make them shine regardless.\n- Thematic level design sometimes comes at a cost in player direction. Expect to run in circles every now and then, after missing a button that isn't quite visible enough.\nNegatives:\n- Not enough\n- Give me more\nOverall as a firm fan of the old Doom and Quake eras of FPS games, I feel Amid Evil would be among the classics if it had released anywhere before 2002.

And I cannot explain why pretty much no one knows about this game.\nIf you know the mod scenes you know that Doom and Quake are at their very best today. They have updated engines that look absolutely great and some of the level designers still releasing maps are doing things that have greatly surpassed what was possible at the time. For example Arcane Dimensions for Quake, or the countless crazy levels for Doom like Sunder or Deus Vult (if you enjoy the mentality of going big, but there are excellent map packs for all styles). You could essentially still play Doom and Quake for years, still feeling fresh and surprising and fun. The way these games give a tangible, visceral experience of their architecture is still unmatched. The environment is the game, and it has no limits of expression.\nQuake added quality and complexity to the maps, offering more versatility to level design, but it lost quite a bit from Doom when it comes to action gameplay. It ended up more constrained, scaled down. And even today on modern engines Quake is still less flexible and dynamic. Arcane Dimensions tries to improve things, but it's not quite there. So I always wanted to see an hybrid that got the 3D of Quake maps but mixed with a combat system less dull and constrained.\nAmid Evil does exactly that. The engine looks AMAZING. The unfiltered textures are the added value, but the quality goes beyond expectations because they blend this old school look with a modern lighting system. This looks and plays like a liberation of Quake. It's Quake broken free of all its limits and weaknesses.\nAnd, you know, it's sad that this has to be \"just a game on Steam\" among many. Games have no date, people just forget but good games never become obsolete. They just become invisible.\nAmid Evil has all the required traits to sit up there with the kings.\nBut that's why I'd really hope that in some way the developer help making it immortal, by opening it. This game needs an editor so that eventually people can keep it alive. I really hope the game doesn't \"remain\" just a game, but that it truly becomes a new platform. If the developers want to keep making levels and sell them, GREAT. I want them because the quality's close to the best I've ever seen. But please think about opening it and let it live its life. Keep growing it, instead of a thing done and left there after you've completed all the things for the official launch.

That said, you'll still likely have a blast on Normal difficulty and you can freely switch difficulties between episodes if you feel the need.\nThe game's going for the retro aesthetic, and it looks beautiful. The vibrant colors and crisp visuals work really well in my opinion, but the game does offer some visual customizations (saturation, anti-aliasing, etc.) if you have other preferences.\nDue to its Early Access nature, it does still have some issues that I'm hoping will be addressed sooner or later, such as the underwater controls being a bit wonky, especially when trying to get out of any pool. There's also a very specific green axe creature you encounter in one Episode who has the random chance of quite literally shredding you because of odd hit detection with that enemy's attacks.\nAMID EVIL definitely gets my recommendation, if you've played stuff like Heretic and you've been waiting for more, then this is a good fix for that.", "hours": 13.8, "username": "BippoErnesti", "products": 7785, "found_helpful": 3, "early_access": true}

The weapons feel and sound powerful. The movement ist very fluid and fast. Enemies are creative in design and use verticallity in their own movement. The evil laughing when you pick up a new weapon is genius. Level design is top notch, oldschool but not too confusing for me. I especially love the geometrys and scale of some levels. The graphics are real good, it's a mix of pixelated textures and very crisp light-effects combined with a very colorful pallete. You feel that the graphics aren't pixelated because of some bs trend, they have a concept and it's well executed. Overall they took what was great about hexen, heretic and doom and left out the annoying parts and modernized it where necessary. Bravo i say :D Ouh and optionality is also a part i really like, you can turn on and off some of the gameplay features, such as how you want your rage mode triggered, good HUD and Graphics options etc...\nMy Cons: Without Temporal Anti-Aliasing, it's unplayable for me. The Image gets really really noisy, to the point where it makes me feel sick. This would be the first time in my entire life where a game makes me feel sick. FXAA is also very noisy on my end, and tinkering with graphics options and resolution scaling also didn't do it.

It's challenging enough on 'easy' for me, bordering on tense; and it's just plain fun.\nI do have a few caveats though, but I think they mostly have to do with me becoming more comfortable with the game the longer I play it. I am prone to motion sickness with video games, and I had to do some fiddling with options, but I think I'm finally over the almost-nausea I was feeling. The other nitpick I have is all the fonts are very hard to read.

{"product_id": "673130", "page": 18, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-12-02", "text": "This game is awesome.\nFirst off, the visuals are lovely. It has that crunchy pixel look, but HD-ified. The aesthetic really works, and I absolutely love how colorful everything is. It looks great, nuff said.\nThe real meat is, of course, the gameplay.\nThe movement is snappy and fast and just feels good. Even platforming and jumping around works. It just works.\nThe weapons are suprisingly unique, both in the visual and gameplay department. One of my favorites is the sword. A simple press of the button and you swing it to send a rather large blade-like projectile towards the face of the nearest bad guy. It feels great swinging this thing around and good aim allows you to hit multiple enemies in one fell swoop.\nAnother fun one is the trident. It shoots out bolts of electricity machine gun style. But, it has a fun little extra feature. When you kill and enemy, they will start to flash and convulse. Keep zapping them and they explode into a glorious fountain of blood and guts, and zap nearby enemies for good measure.\nEvery single weapon (both yours and enemies) fires projectiles. No hit scan in sight. Combined with the brisk pace of movement, you will quickly get into a rhythm of strafing and dodging enemies and taking them apart piece by piece.\nThe enemies are similarly varied. You have basic melee trash to mow down, but there are a range of interesting and more powerful baddies to encounter. The upgraded grunt has a weapon very similar to the sword. The cool bit is, your sword projectiles clash with theirs, allowing you to \"block\" their attacks. There are also flying enemies that shoot bolts of energy at you, big knight looking fellas that lob bouncing bombs, and more. I can't wait to see what's in store.\nWeapons work on a mana system that functions pretty much like ammo. There are also health pickups, including little ones that allow you to go above the standard cap of 100 (and some special pickups that max you out at 200). Basic stuff, it just works.\nThe cherry on top is the soul system. Killed enemies drop souls that charge up a meter below your health. Upon maxing it out, your next attack activates a mode that powers up all of your weapons. Your basic axe turns into a spinning implement of death. The standard staff which normally shoots out just a few lightly homing projectiles powers up to shoot a torrent of them. My favorite, the sword, functions much the same as normal, except it's projectiles bounce of walls and can cause quite a bit of death and destruction in enclosed spaces.\nAs you murder in your powered up state, picked up souls extend it's length. If you're quick and deadly, you could potentially power through a whole level this way.\nThe levels themselves are strange and labyrinthian, a throw back to the FPS games of old. You will be collecting keys, discovering secrets, and marveling at imposing architecture as you slice and dice your way to the exit. The end level screen gives a familiar kill percentage, secrets found, as well as par time, classic Doom style.\nTLDR: If you like classic FPS games, there is a lot to like here. They still have a few episodes to release, but there is plenty here to enjoy including a pretty intense horde mode with several arenas. IMHO, it's well worth the asking price.", "hours": 5.9, "username": "stoolio", "products": 2416, "found_helpful": 5, "early_access": true}

People are few and far between. In my 20-ish hours of wandering around/raiding I had found 2 online players and around 5-6 bases to raid. The map is too damn big, if it was a quarter of the size, it'd still be too big...\nRaiding is too easy, you will see a lot of reviews saying that level 3+ walls can be destroyed with level 1 items. This is true, my group of three banged on level 3 walls with tier 1/2 items for around 10 mins to get inside of it. You don't need dynamite/TNT, all you need are melee weapons. And if you really try hard, you can just use the cannon and demolish an entire base within seconds. Make raiding harder...\nThere are 4 different roles 'ANY' player can obtain. I say 'ANY' because all you need to do is go to the location of obtaining said role and sit in the chair for around 60 seconds and BOOM, you are that role. President, Governor, Sheriff and Chief are the roles you can be, that's it. Most new players, including myself, will just join a game and become President just to raise the taxes. As you play more and more it becomes a dead joke.\nI understand this game has a lot of RP potential however I wouldn't try RPing on any Official servers because they are filled with trolls, including myself. This game is a survival game, expect people to raid you without RPing. It really grinds my gears when I raid some random player and starts yelling at me in voice chat or game chat calling me a POS just because he died. Get a gun and defend your base, plain and simple. Don't cry, get revenge.\nI've played a few survival games in my day and this one by far is the worst game to build in. You first must place the 'Thatch' wall down and then collect the resource you want to upgrade it to. Then for 15-20 seconds a wall/floor/ceiling you will hit it with a hammer slowly upgrading it. It is for this reason I choose not to have a base and just roam/raid and sell the loot for a quick buck.\nResearching is still something I really haven't gone too much into only because when I raid people they have what I need. However I can say that it requires a lot of grinding if you want to research a lot of stuff. This is another point where I realized that RP is almost required. 1 person could be a tailor while another is a baker and so on and so fourth. Researching requires money and items to learn it. Money is rather easy to obtain however does take some time.\nAs for the performance of the game. I get an average of around 60 FPS in most parts of the map, I have noticed when you walk near a base that decays you will lose some frames but its not too bad. In the 20-ish hours that I have played the game, my game has crashed only once and not sure the reason. This game requires a very good GPU and ram. If you have anything less than 16gb of ram, I wouldn't even bother buying this game. I have also read reviews of this game taking 10-20 mins to load into a server. Again the devs have said that it is highly recommended that you put this game on an SSD. I myself have the game on my M.2 drive. From pushing play in the steam client to getting in game takes me around 2-3 mins.\nSide note: Most of the negative reviews complain about loading times and crashes. If you have a decent computer and a SSD/M.2 you really won't have any issues. Also these negative reviews were during the launch week which I can't say for certain but I heard it was not a good launch. Nevertheless the game ain't bad, I enjoy it. I troll. I raid. I have fun with friends.\nOh and there is no fall damage and you can breathe underwater.

ADVICE TO NEW / PROSPECTIVE PLAYERS!\nA lot of my complaints in my previous review have been improved in one way or another.\nOverall, I love this game. The combat is really unique and fresh when compared to so many first person shooters out there. The melee combat has a learning curve, but once you get the basic mechanics of it and get some practice, it is a LOT of fun. It's the perfect way to continue enjoying Dying Light after you've played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the main game. If you look at most of the negative reviews, they don't have nearly as many hours logged as me - keep that in mind.\nIt does have it's issues though. Currently, there is an issue with people teaming up which can be really annoying because you stand no chance 2v1. Also, the player base is pretty low currently. I've never had an issue finding a game personally, but it is very, very low as of writing this review, so I'm hoping the small amount of dedicated players continue playing, or at least there's new players coming on board.\nMy advice to any new players is to give the game a chance. If you're not a hardcore dying light fan then it might not be for you, as you have to be really comfortable with the parkour and killing zombies to play well. But if you're looking for a fun pvp game with melee combat, this is the best I've played. It can be very frustrating when you have yet to figure out the mechanics and you're playing against people who are very experienced, but you got to try and learn as you play and watch some tutorials online.\nKeep in mind that this is an early access game, so it's not going to have as many features as the full game likely will. Me personally, I'm pretty satisfied with the game as-is and would probably continue playing it if the player base grew, despite the other issues.\nMy recommendations for improving the game would be of course to address the above issues, but also add some sort of deathmatch mode, or just an open lobby just for people to screw around, practice combat, etc. It gives people a chance to play without as much at stake, and also would give people a chance to get comfortable enough with the combat to be competitive and mitigate the steep learning curve.", "hours": 76.9, "user_id": "76561198406947828", "username": "SpiralOut", "products": 19, "found_helpful": 2, "early_access": true}

There is an awesome fluidity of movement in Dying Light that really shows in a PvP version of that when chasing other players down to kill them.\nI also very much enjoy the way the matches play out. Kill some zombies, a boss, collect some samples, get stronger, get enough samples you can evacuate the map.

The best thing about this game is the freedom to interact with the old west - or at least a condensed version of it.  There are very few old west survival games out there.  If you are familiar with Reign of Kings this game will be very familiar to it.  Much of the same code was used to make Heat.\nYou start out with a bindle.  A stick with a bag tied to the end is a bindle.  With it you can harvest wood and stones and if you have played other survival games you get the drift very quickly.  You must research new technology and since this is set in the old west you will break into that 19th century technology pretty quick.\nOne thing that this survival game has that few others do is a usable shipping system.  You can sell your excess and purchase what you do need.  This helps a great amount with research costs and items like clay which is difficult to harvest and only worth 4 cents - buy it.\nThe game is a bit unbalanced.\nIt takes a long time to harvest/skin killed animals.\nCombat is a bit wonky and the AI is sketch, but passable.\nThe prices for some items on the market are a bit inflated on some items and the shipping tax is very high, but its worth it as prices do not fluctuate and its nice to have a game with some shipping in it.\nI had to bind q to attack and wedge it down with a guitar pick.  Takes about 5 minutes to get to the hide - which are worth between $50 and $500 so very worth it.  Cougar ate me once while I was doing this. Very sad.\nYou build a house and claim land with a flag.  A flag you have to pay taxes to keep claimed to stave off decay.  It is very similar to other survival games.\nThe game really shines as a 19th century survival simulation. There are not too many of them so you sort of must judge them on a curve.  You can also have babies with the opposing gender and then raise them to do things, I have not done so but I hear its a hoot.\nSlavery has been left out because that would be a PR nightmare.  Plus its the old west, not the old south.   Maybe it is post civil war.\nThe map is based on the US but much more condensed.  There is a train that will run you over.  Sell hides and stone to make money.  Build your house in the center of your claim!  Store your cash on your flag when you log off.\nGo west for more challenge.  Go east for more interaction.

I could go on, but first you need to decide if you love FPSes, or if you just like to shoot things. Gears of War, Halo, Half-Life, all of these games focused on stories and delivering a meaty, cinematic campaign. Games like Dusk and Ion Maiden are more interested in core gameplay, player empowerment, level design, and enemy types.\nThe last two are what separated Doom and Quake. Doom was all about hordes of terrible aiming minions. Halo aped this to some extent, where you really felt like a single soul against an invasion. Quake and Half Life went in the opposite direction, with tougher, deadlier enemies, but less of them overall. Obviously this is an oversimplification, but it helps establish Amid Evil's design philosphy.\nThis game puts you... the 'Champion'. As a mortal who has attained access to the 'higher planes' you find yourself alone against the evils in each plane or dimension. The story isn't really there, but it wasn't in Ultimate Doom either. Its more about feeling like a badass. Its also got some of the best FPS level design I think I've seen in years. Serious Sam comes to mind in that you have big open environments, but the enemies are more Hexen or Quake. They are tough, and they will absolutely kill you in seconds if you mess up.\nWeapon variety is somewhat limited, but helped by a similar mechanic to PainKiller. You collect so many souls, you kill once more, and you get supercharged, and all of your weapons get alternate attacks that wreck face. A single melee axe becomes a freaking enemy lawn mower. A homing projectile staff becomes a flamethrower. Etc. Etc. Its an interesting mechanic, but since it can be hard to control or save, I'm not sure I like it.\nBack to the level design, Secrets. They. Are. Everywhere. Devs did a great job of rewarding you for exploring the big somewhat open maps. Its much better than Project Warlock, but not as good as original Doom secrets. Obviously secrets are awesome and give you access to better loot or weapons you normally wouldn't find that early.\nWhat are you getting with EA? 5 chapters and an endless horde mode. I can't speak for multiplayer because I find dedicated multiplayer games are always better. As it stands this game is awesome and worth 20 for retro FPS enthusiasts. If you loved STRAFE, Dusk, Project Warlock, and dream of the days when Quake, Shadow Warrior, and Doom shared a spot on your bookshelf, this is absolutely worth 20.\nFor everyone else?

There's also a surprising amount of atmosphere in each level that really keeps you drawn in.\nCombat felt endlessly satisfying to me, pretty much every weapon feels great to use except for the starting \"staff\" that just kinda gets outshined by the others.\nPopping your \"soul mode\" (quad damage) and lobbing planets or swords at groups of enemies just never gets old. There's also an endless horde mode that feels surprisingly engaging too.\nDefinitely recommended if you like arena shooters of this era, or even just shooters in general!", "hours": 7.3, "username": "neeko", "products": 375, "early_access": true}

It's a weird feeling.\nLevel design is very impressive, it's all huge surreal structures with twists and turns, secrets that still elude me after a few playthroughs. There's no fall damage and you can't drown so there's nothing preventing you from exploring, trying seemingly impossible jumps and generally being reckless. Once you get used to the game I recommend trying Warrior mode (starting every lavel naked) as it really makes you appreciate every item you get, you can see how much care went into their placement.\nCombat is not as fast and visceral as anything in Id's Software's catalog, it's kinda floaty but I grew to like it very much anyway. It has some subtleties, like the Trident triggering a satisfying chain reaction at the cost of more ammo and increased vulnerability, or the sword's shockwave hitting multiple enemies from the side, encouraging you to strafe and reposition often. AI is serviceable, with humanoid enemies being able to leap over pits, block your attacks with their own and dodge.\nAll in all this is one of my favorite games this year even though it's not technically finished.

With chunky pixels, large brilliantly designed levels, we still get shaders & reflections to convey materials, dynamic lighting and shadowing to enhance atmosphere, wonderful particle effects to keep combat satisfying, and just the proper amount of detail sprinkled about to make every vibrant scene and landscape feel worthy of its own screenshot and moment of pause.\nThe fantasy setting allows the level design and artstyle to be a uniquely alien, strikingly colourful, haunting yet absolutely beautiful strange land - Well, multiple dimensions, constantly reminding you that these places were built with otherworldly beings in mind, not tiny humans.\n(No orcs, dwarves, elves or dragons to be found in this fantasy world!)\nStill, this alien sense doesn't mean that the level design is overly convoluted, labyrinthine, but is balanced, paced and structured to lead the player with purpose to the detours it creates, while leaving landmarks to help you orientate toward your destination.\nI've been disappointed before with the look and feel of a lot of indie FPS games.\nUsually when they want to emphasize gameplay, they might leave level design to a proc-gen algorithm, so that they might be able to focus on refining that gameplay loop, and yet you often see indie FPS' with weak gunplay, not enough impact effects like blood spurts, smoke, sparks, flashes, decals, enemies don't flinch, guns don't seem to react to being fired, everything is too muted, except in some filters, colours, shaders and level lighting that comes standard with engines. And then there's nothing else there.\n(When did a lot of devs converge on thinking that adding the white flash as feedback on hitting enemies was a good idea?)\nI can open up Halo from 2001 and it'll have aliens spurting out comical amounts of purple blood, flinch to every shot they take in manners that affect their accuracy, particle effects fly all around, and guns react with every shot you make.\nNot to mention Doom, Quake, FEAR etc etc.\nAnd those games had all sorts of other things on top of those gameplay mechanics; proper levels, stories, enemy variety and pretty great AI.\nNot only does AMID EVIL skip procedural generation in favour of excellent level design, but it also has fun weapons and enemies.\nThere are 7 impactful weapons, from a massive axe that will on common overkills make enemies explode into blood and bits or normally easily chop heads with Doomy blood fountains, a staff that fires homing glowing bolts that hit with a satisfying particle explosion, sometimes staggering your prey, an energy sword that can slice an enemy in half, with a satisfying\nof a noise it makes on impact, a lightning trident that encourages you to overkill to more easily stun enemies and make them explode, sending chain lightning to nearby victims, to a planet thrower, that throws planets at enemies, exploding if you couldn't guess, to what basically amounts to a shotgun/nailgun that sends enemies with massive force flying, pinning them against walls, and if it somehow doesn't kill in one hit, the enemy is left staggered, with massive long crystals impaled through them, to the BFG of the magical world, with equally good effects.\nAnd that's without going into the soul mode that just makes everything into a god killing bringer of room-clearing destruction for a short period of time.\nEnemies come in surprising variety, each of the current 5 episodes has its own world with its own denizens, usually following a loose pattern of 4-5 enemies per world, with a melee type, maybe an agile dodging leaper, a bigger slower heavy hitter with maybe some wave attack, an enemy who prefers to strafe and engage at range, to maybe some flying enemy or roller. But they are still given their own identity in each world, their own role in the combat chess, their design can easily at a distance telegraph their threat level and likely attack, and they have a few tricks up their sleeves, from different attacks, to movement patterns that keep you on your toes but not on your heels (unlike most games, not just indie but even AAA games, where braindead hordes that swarm you in a straight line are the norm).\nAll the bosses have been unique and rather fun, the creepy parasite with horrifying sounds and the latest forgemaster stood out as the most memorable and engaging ones so far.\nIn my playthrough I haven't really encountered many bugs, had one minor one when I first started that reset some tweaked settings one time, and one that was immediately fixed in a patch.\nI have a laptop that's old by now, intel i7-4710HQ quadcore 2.5GHz, Nvidia 840M 2GB VRAM, 12GB RAM, Win10 64bit, but I still played the game with every setting at epic, minus Anti-Aliasing OFF, and Resolution at a custom one that the game allowed me to tweak incredibly easily in the main menu to 960x540. Game played this way at 60fps 95% of the time, the only dip I saw was in Episode 5 level 1 into the 40-50fps range. I can honestly live with that, looked good, felt great for 97% of the time, what more can you ask for?\nA lot of freedom in customizing your experience, graphically, to HUD and gameplay, the devs even put the list of the cheats with descriptions in their codex that you can access at any moment in the pause menu.\nMusic is fantastic, fits the alien worlds, will be buying that soundtrack once it's available, the dynamic nature of the ambient and combat music is well handled. The fantasy theme has allowed some beautiful use of colours with strong purples, blues, greens and reds, while also designing most landscapes to be strange and eerie. Gameplay is worth it already on its own. Story is still a bit mysterious, but I'm engaged with the world the devs have created.\nBuy it, it rivals a lot of AAA stuff out there, high quality, and its unique presentation allows it to stand out as a different flavour above the rest.\n[EP6 Update]\nIf you thought the previous episodes had a lot of alien surreal vibes to their environments and atmosphere, then be prepared for how much the Indefatigable devs upped the ante from the last time, really leaning in on strange otherworldly magical places with the most breathtaking and mind-bending level design on display yet, and I already loved the previous episodes!\nEnemies too are just off the scale, even more fun variety at display!\nYou got tired of humanoid enemies? Well here's some acid lobbing snakes, leaping spiders, charging mounts and sharks you f**ks! That's on top of different mages with their maces and eclipse throwing spells and cool miniboss type bigger mages with a charge attack just floating above.\nAndrew Hulshult enhances the magical cathedral feel for the episode again brilliantly with his music.\nThis is a trip not to be missed.\nWeapons got some cool new meaty effects, more staggers, more pain sounds, more gore, more bang for your buck.\nOptimization still rocks.\nJust beat the episode, was an utter blast! The environments are massive in their scale, loved the clever use of water for added dimensionality in traversal, and it really made that last fight with the Twin Terrors feel amazing, added tension with their shrieks and attack patterns, being suspended in the air with only a sphere of water to maneuver in above an endless expanding arcane dimension, just such a fun well designed encounter!", "hours": 32.4, "user_id": "76561197976091020", "username": "Nathan", "products": 387, "found_helpful": 5, "early_access": true}

It was so bad that I wasn't even able to play the game outside of the small zone to practice in for casual without missing everything I try to hit and taking a lot of damage.\nThe controls also felt very floaty to me when i tried to use mouse and key board but playing with a controller helped a bit with that in game. The tutorial section was also not very helpful in terms of learning to play the game. Yes it showcased how the game works in a cinematic but it didn't give the player anyway to learn how to play first hand. Even if it was something small like putting them in the pregame lobby area for casual mode with a few zombies, human AIs and some onscreen text telling how the game's mechanics worked would've been very helpful.\nOverall, I really wanted to like this game but I just am unable to play due to limitations and wonky controls.

The important part is how the inspirations are implemented and whether they create a worthwhile experience. This is the point where most of these retro throwback games fail by completely misunderstanding the nuances that made the source material something that stood the test of time. These mistakes happen because often the devs either include gameplay systems that clash with the simple but effective premises of the titles they draw inspiration from (i.e. loot mechanics, upgrade trees, RPG systems, in what is supposed to be a pure action game) or by dumbing down the level design and core gameplay to the point where the game is like a lesser version of the source material.\nLuckily, Amid Evil avoids falling in these common traps. The game doesn't waste the player's time with anything that isn't involved with the core gameplay elements which are simply, fast paced combat with explorative elements and minor puzzle solving. The devs have also put special care into making sure that Amid Evil doesn't feel like heretic/unreal but worse. Character's movement is fast by default, each weapon has very distinct properties with defined strengths and weaknesses, advanced tech can be performed with relative ease giving the player enough tools to express his or her own style while keeping the feeling of the game fast and frantic. Levels are complex enough to work as sprawling mazes for first time players while remaining as open-ended challenges for veteran players who want to speedrun. These elements work in synergy with how enemies are designed. Devs took the best elements from heretic and unreal (clear patterns, specialization of enemies, projectiles instead of hitscan) while leaving out the glaring flaws of these titles (Easily exploitable AI, enemies reading your inputs) this creates dynamic situations where it's never too easy to annihilate everything, but never too hard to limit how the players decide to express themselves. The sense of adventure is very well realized as each episode in Amid Evil has very distinct atmosphere, enemies and map designs.

Adventuring is fun, but there needs to be a little bit more reason to the adventuring than NPC pirates and the occasional treasure chest on a shoreline. Within that 16 hours I have nearly all of the most desired weapons and armor, have built a few things and done a fair bit of sailing/adventuring. Not all that many resources yet and there would be more challenge and excitement if the crafting list was ten times longer. But you get the feel once this game is more hashed out it'll be a load of fun. The base they have built thus far for this game is a good one, it just needs quite a bit more love and work before it is a full fleshed game.

Second after entering main menu I feel that i cna barely control the mouse cursor, probably cause game is designed for a gamepad or something. Mouse cursor feels like im underwater, if that makes sense.\n2. constant fps drops. I had a match where i tried to kill a Demolisher, but every time i would aim my camera towards him - i would jump to 8 fps, static, no idea why.\n3. Preparation zone where everyone supposed to fight each other, while waiting for a match to be filled with ppl. Why even bother implementing it, if most of ppl are just sitting in a SAFE ZONE. Why do you need a safe zone in a preparation phase, that doesnt matter? Also, the one who gets to join first - gets the ranged weapon, and just waits for ppl to exit the \"SAFE ZONE\" to shoot them in the face.\n4. Balance and mechanics are not thought through. I played coupla matches and every fight i had with other players was the same - turtling and waiting for parry. Other players NEVER attack. We just sit, with our finger on a Parry button ,waiting for the other guy to strike first. #funmechanics.\n5. What is even the point of gathering blood, if that will only make you a target for everyone else? And then someone can kill you at a helicopter area, get your blood and leave.\nThats just something from the top of my head.

{"product_id": "766370", "page": 25, "page_order": 7, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-09-22", "text": "This game was an impulse buy for me due to the combination of battle royale, zombies and parkour keywords. And I got lucky - it has been a lot of fun playing it. I've been finding myself in the \"now this REALLY is the last game for today\" loop for several hours after I've decided to stop gaming for the night.\nBut be warned - even though it is tons of fun, it's definitely not easy.\nThe combat aspect of this game has a huge learning curve associated with it. It looks simple enough, but actually surviving both the zombies and other players is very challenging. I've never played the original Dying Light game, so it was all very new to me. The current version of the game doesn't really teach you much w.r.t. how to actually fight anything (I do hope that the devs spend some time on this before the end of early-access). I ended up getting gutted several times by various Twitch streamers, so I just tuned into their streams and they were kind enough to actually explain what's going on. But even now, that (I think that) I know all the \"hidden\" moves, it's still a challenge to actually win a PvP encounter. Guess there's still something I'm missing.\nAs it is a battle royale with only 12 people per match you might be tempted to think that the experience is less than that of Fortnite, PUBG, BlackOps4, etc. But that would be wrong - it is just right for this game. The PvE/PvP encounters are so involved that, if there were any more players it would most likely start sucking the fun out of the game. The map is also just big enough for everyone to get to loot in peace in the beginning, but small enough that when you're pulling your best parkour moves, you can easily cross the map in about 30 seconds.\nEven though it hasn't been easy to pick up this game, I still enjoy it immensely. It still has a way to go, but that is to be expected of an early access game. But the core fun is there, so it should turn out to be a great game given some more time.", "hours": 45.0, "username": "dukadok", "products": 77, "early_access": true}

Don't lission to that dude saying that you cant join servers. I played for the first time 2 days ago and got on the first server I picked. The game can get hard do to all the threats, but thats part of what makes it fun. Id give this game 4 outa 5 stars. Only reason I wouldnt give 5 is there needs to be more content. Like different kinds of meat for the different kinds of animals, same with trees giving different kinds of wood. Add fishing polls please this is a game built around the sea. More walls would be a nice addtion also. Add fur to be dropped from the tigers and fur gear, ivory from the elphants, different hids and gear from each anamil. Most of the ground work is there they just need content. One thing that really needs some attention is the amount of things you can build. IDK why you can build gluiders it dosnt seem to fit. Add larger chests, a gun smith and a bunch of guns relavent to the era. Adds some birds some fish, like fish you can see. As you can see the game needs a bunch of stuff, but it is early access and for that being said it still gets a 4 outa 5, that is me being hopeful for its future development.

They Really Should Just Get Rid Of The Block All Together and have it like dying light dash back is your dodge and nothing else or they need to figure out how to fix the block. In combat you find your self standing still and moving backward with you and the enemy hitting block and waiting and hitting block until someone makes the wrong move and gets stunned sometimes these will go on for 20 minutes or more. This type of counter system is exactly what made For Honor Very Boring. So I will recommend this based on the other aspects of this game the looting,hive system,boss and leveling system.

Fire absolutely melts through your health bar, and the bleed effect is too agressive; it shouldn't last forever and deals too much damage for something that is so easy to inflict. Perhaps there should be different grading tiers to each effect? Also parry and its punishing is both wayyyy too easy for the reward and quite inconsistent. Moreover £15 feels a bit expensive for some legendary skins, a mask and early access...\nI also wish to see more weapon variety, customisable parkour moves maybe? These moves would just be for cosmetic purposes not to give in game advantages. I would also love to see skill trees, and different arche types have strengths and weaknesses.\nFinally, when in a chase, it's quite hard to either catch or escape the other player. I believe there needs to be some sort of system to dictate the speed or fluidity at which you move. For example, getting a little boost after executing a parkour move, and having different archetypees run faster, have more combat stamina, and these archetypes having skill trees as I mentioned would be awesome.\nI recommend the game, but perhaps wait a bit as I dont believe this pack is worth its full price... yet.

This game has so much potential, just like RoK but it's far from reaching it. I have not seen any blatant hackers on my server but duping is happening and it's very game-breaking considering how much of a grind this game is.\n- The building system is trash compared to Reign of Kings (one of it's best features). How do you go from a block by block system like Minecraft to a buggy wall/floor/ceiling snapping system like Rust?\n- Crafting anything of significance takes far too long. Even some basic things take 10-15 minutes to produce at a workbench. It feels pointless and done for the sake of a blatant time sink.\nMap is far too big and a waste of resources for 32 player servers. Congrats - you've severely limited your player base on the system requirements alone and made it worse with such a giant useless map.\n- President aspect literally lost its appeal in the first week. No one even cares to fight over it on my server anymore.\n- Raiding balance seems way off. Used 20-25 cannon shots on enemy base made of logs, not a single outside wall broke but damage was done inside.\n- My full stone base was 90% destroyed after only several hours of being offline? Many players claim that iron tools, guns, and iron/steel weapons can destroy stone in a short amount of time. What's the point of building anything? The devs don't even learn from where they left off with their last game.\nCANNOT recommend this game as it is right now and I'd be extremely cautious before buying due to the dev's poor track record of abandoning games.

You can also costumize your land/group flag.\n- Character's progression through XP gain. You'll be able to improve your character's stats and unlock more blueprints once you level up.\n- Compass and in-game map with grid and marker system available\n- Finding food and water is easy\n- Plenty land available to build on.\n- Good modular building system, also easy to learn.\n- Ability of building houses/bases with different kinds of designs\n- Structure upgrade feature\n- Road building\n- Farming\n- A countless amount of items to craft and resources to harvest.\n- Big diversity of craftable items to unlock through the several different tech trees available in the catalogue\n- Several crafting stations that can be upgraded\n- Weapons appropriated for the wild west era. There are also siege weapons in the game.\n- Pets/Animal Taming/Mounts\n- Your pets or servants (humanoid NPCs you can eventually have working for you) will perform tasks to help you, just interact with their interface and give them orders. They can also help you carrying items to relief your inventory burden.\n- You can capture and enslave other players or humanoid NPCs.\n- You can become a Chief, Sheriff, Governor or even the President of America. While under one of these power positions in a server, you'll have benefits (pay lower taxes, own extra property, collect rewards from exclusive chests, ...).\n- Create a family and multiply - you can conceive babies or simply adopt them, watch them grow and they'll have the ability to help or protect you.\n- Newspaper: Publish ads on the classifieds section, see the server players obituary, Most Wanted section: set bounties on players and hunt them in exchange for money, learn how to adopt a baby, see the day of the year and the weather for the current and incoming days or simply gamble by spending money in the scratchcards or lottery!\n- Some kind of sense of humor (if you ever try it, you'll know what I mean), and weirdness at the same time (the action of making love to another player or NPC envolves the weirdest mating dance I've ever seen, not even National Geographic would show it; if you eat your own poop (ewww) you'll die - useful to carry your leftovers with you, just in case you get stuck somewhere and need to suicide)\n- The similarities to other games aren't actually a bad thing, I got that \"feels like home\" when I play this game for a reason, it reminds me of other things I've experienced in a few games of the survival genre, and that is making me enjoying the game even more, actually.\n- The launch wasn't that great, some gamebreaking issues/broken mechanics messed it up a bit, but fortunately most of the things were already fixed.\n- Actually, some things still need adjustment, but if devs keep patching the game at a good pace and actually listening to the community complains this time, stuff will get where it should be eventually.\n- May be RAM or CPU demanding\n- RoK flashbacks???\n- Random rubberbanding\n- No single player or co-op modes available in the game. Only the option of manually setting up your dedicated server through steamcmd to host a local game.\n- Hard to find a good server to play on at times, this isn't specifically a game issue, but a community issue. As some already said in a review somewhere around here, HEAT seems to be Rust in the Wild West.\n- Lack of limits/rules for PvP, PvE, RP or PvP/PvE hybrid servers. The game needs more server settings to prevent players from breaking certain rules or griefing others. This includes an option to enable/disable player VS player and structure damage. This game can learn with the big diversity of server settings Conan Exiles has, available for the server admins to adjust, without the need of mods or plugins\n- Grind is a thing on HEAT. While there's a big amount of items and resources available to the player, there's also a grindy side on this game, specially if you play solo or in a small group and need to upgrade your base and your doors.\n- Plenty money goes to the land claim flags to keep your properties for longer, even with a moderated tax rate\n- Shipping fees may be a little high\n- The combat (at least between the player and AI) needs some polishment\n- There are some collision issues (AI getting stuck on rocks, trees or even in doors, glitching through mountains, ...)\n- Too much time to finish harvesting an animal (the process until there's nothing remaining is slow)\n- Frequent management of your owned NPCs statuses may be annoying at times, even if you add food or water to their inventories (removing them from your party will put them asleep, preventing constant \"maintenance\"\n- Owned NPCs can disappear to a bug one or another time\n- Babies, while not ordered to stop, are able to open doors or run away through window frames.\n- While in a \"no way out\" situation (like getting stuck somewhere and now I need to starve to a slow death because I can't kill myself other way), there is no suicide option through a key, button or command, you can only eat nasty stuff like your own poop to suicide\n- Hmm let's hope the player base doesn't drop that much, uh?\nApart of everything, HEAT still kept me interested enough to buy it and keep playing it. I was looking forward to play it for a while already, and I'm actually not disappointed with this game. It does need more adjustments and will become better if it keeps being worked on. Only time will tell if devs don't fail again and keep working on it. Who knows!! They surely lost the trust from many players due to their past, but it would be a waste if they abandoned HEAT in the future. Heat is a game with potential, don't let it just stay by there. If you start liking it, it can be actually addicting. There are already plenty features in the game, good for a start.\nI recommend this game, it has plenty nice features already and it has a fair price. But also do not advise purchasing it right now if you're too worried about the cons above or don't feel safe enough to purchase it yet at least. Always take in consideration the fact you're looking at a rocky road called Early Access game... where the development team and community is involved, it's always an uncertain future.\nIf you enjoy games under the survival sandbox genre, or games with the Wild West theme, and you're used to the Early Access survival process, then\nis for you.", "hours": 338.1, "username": "VVILD jester", "products": 519, "found_helpful": 61, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": true}

I have 2 ARK accounts with well over 4k hours between them and left ARK some time ago when they introduced Power Armor and Lasers and all that bunk. I was looking for something not so crazy and unbalanced as ARK and discovered this game on sale for $7.50 and thought, what the heck, let's try it out. The idea of being a pirate and having a ship with cannons seemed to appeal to me. My 7 hours of initial play were on an official Standard server called Timberfrost or something like that. Ping was around 53. My computer is about 5 years old with a GTX 670 Ti Video card and on high graphics I am getting a consistant 43 FPS. The graphics are nice, not too shabby at all, reminds me of ARK so they are probably using the same engine.\nYou wake up with a broken ship's rudder as your weapon/tool. Do the basic collect this and that, while you are guided by a tutorial questline that teaches you the basics and advanced elements of the game. Learn to hunt, go into caves for metal, yada yada. I was in a cave and came across some poor smuck and killed him for all his booty. I'm a pirate after all! 600 copper and 100 tin he donated to me, after which he logged out and probably rage quit. Sorry bud! I'm not really much of a PKer but what the heck. I built a little wooden base and logged out after 5 hours to take a short break. Upon logging back in about 30 minutes later, I heard a knock-knock, knocking of my door. Seems someone was trying to bash their way in. I patiently awaited on the other side of the door and after a couple more swings, he was in. Or rather he tried to get in because at that moment I leapt upon him and whacked, smacked, and cracked him with my bronze axe. Down he went... and he was only able to hit me once. Boy he had lots of loot on him, including a steel axe, some seige bolts, and a flintlock pistol with 10 bullets, along with some pirate armor. Oh Boy! I repaired the damage he did to the house, fortified it, and then moved away, knowing he would come back eventually when I was offline. Now he can waste his time bashing down the 20 doors and extra walls I placed just to find nothing.\nSo I'm having fun... and this is what playing a game is about. Heck I would pay full price for this at $15 but at $7.50 it's a steal. I haven't noticed any bugs in my short time. Sure it's a slowly evolving game but all the elements are there for you to enjoy. The server population might not be the greatest but so far I'm content with not running over a bunch of other players all the time. Anyway, if you buy the game, come to Timberfrost and look up Jadeheart.

This new marketing policy sucks I would agree with you, but at the same time look at the reality, life isn't getting any cheaper and games get so complex you need bigger teams to produce them.\nWould you rather support an indie dev team (1-2 game developers) or a bigger development team? The answer lies in the price you pay right here, right now (or wait for the F2P release).

No matter how disappointed you can be with the franchise, post feedback and help them improve then.\nFast paced, skill based, this version of dying light will get you on edge and provide exactly what it did in single player. A fast paced and nervous experience where a split of a second can decide your life or death (well PVE might be more tolerant than this version, true). The best point about this format is how easy it is to come back into a game after winning/losing, because the game itself isn't the only thing fast paced, the loading menus and time to find players are as well.

So for a Alpha game with this amount of folieage and harvestable stuff. im amazed by how good the performance is CLIENT SIDE. still some server performance needed. though it minor!\nEngame is sorta a thing in this game that do not exist since if you wanted you could make a giant project to make a village for the server so big that it could take months to make! so that is what i really like about this game its not just a quick 10hours and then done like other surivial game! you have lots of grinding. fun and exploring. the map is HUGE!\nThis is one of my favorite game of all time already. from 60 hours of game time. loads of fun with friends. 100% worth the 17Euro and way better than other surivial long term games on the market at this moment!\nLove you devs hope to see you guys interact more with your game's community like Make a Propper website with forums bug reporting and others. and get more streamers to show case the game. even if it means to so sponsorships etc! make the game great and keep it growing!", "hours": 255.8, "username": "Meow", "products": 121, "found_helpful": 2, "early_access": true}

There wasn't a big enough following for this game, barely any marketing and it flew right under the radar.\nAgain this game is a blast and the gameplay is new and refreshing but due to the fact that there is maybe 200 people playing at the same time I have to give it a bad review.\nAlso because of the low player count I'm forced to play with people outside the US and trying to do melee combat with crazy lag is aids.", "hours": 32.9, "user_id": "76561198352920880", "username": "Willy", "products": 68, "found_helpful": 12, "early_access": true}

While there are many reviews that say to stay away and that the game is unplayable are wrong and let me explain why. I have played Bad blood for give or take 50 hours and in that experience I have found a game that #1 is about as balanced as game could ever be at launch. granted things like the shotgun and khukri are powerful even those as of the latest patch have been nerfed. #2 there is great optimization here very rarely do I find fps loss of any kind on my machine. However there are some things that need to be addressed #1 the wait times and general server performance. I cannot count in my time playing how many times I have been booted for connection told I have too high of ping or have been booted out of pre game lobbies. No game is perfect and this is a good example of that. #2 Combat related mechanics parrying still is one of those things that just does not feel right but that will be something that can be worked on. As of the time of this review 9/19/18 I can without a doubt recommend this game to people as it has a very promising future and a fun and fresh taste to the battle royale genere.

You can be President, Governor. Sheriff or Chief. Detailed crafting menu is fairly easy to get through, simple yet challenging if you want to build a stylish mansion or fort. The AI is really interesting. You have the ability to tame animals and use them as protection while offline. You can even have a child, raise it and then have a grown AI to help fight. A large variety of animals roam the map; cougars, cows, boars, bison, alligators,wolves and many other creatures that make hunting and tracking very immersive. I could talk about what the game needs to be better but I will leave that to the toxic 13er's. Yes this game is in early access and it does wipe more than it should but leveling up early isn't very hard or time consuming and there are many ways to level up: hunting and selling skins, gathering and building or growing crops and trading with other players.

When I saw the description in Steams Summer Sale, I thought that it looked interesting. I gave it a try and bought it.\nI decided that for my very first steps I will start on a PVE-only server with low or zero population at that moment. This gave me the chance to get used to the game functions without having to concentrate on other players at the same time. For players liking PVP there are also servers where this is implemented.\nFor me, buying this game  has definitely been a very good decision. The game caught me instantly and keeps me playing, testing, and very much enjoying.\nThe game starts on a beach, the character has nothing but a sharp stone in his hand and some minor clothes at his body. This is where the tutorial pops up. First task: Find something to eat. So I started walking and searching, found corn and berries. And  I found pirates soon - which killed me instantly. First survival test failed. Restart at the same location as in the beginning. I wanted to know whether I could survive longer, I knew now where those pirates were and went the other direction.\nThe tutorial is in my opinion very well done. It leads from finding food to chopping wood and stone, creating a stone axe and building the first base with a builders desk, a bed and a storage chest. I went on with the tutorial and suddenly realized that an hour, two and three hours quickly went and I still was playing and enjoying.\nOf course, my character died several times. It looks like that tigers also have the task to \"find something to eat\". And there I fully realized that when dying, my character looses everything which he had in his inventory. Bags with the content stay where the char died. So, go there again to pick it up. Of course it was hidden in high grass, I had to search a bit (the location of death is luckily shown on the map). And - the tiger was hidden there, too, still hungry!\nI learned, running away, as quickly as possible, is a very good way to survive. My previous belongings were \"Out of Reach\" for me.\nStrangely, this didn't push me away from this game, in contrary, I wanted to survive longer. And I have many hours and days which kept me enjoying ingame. I learned how to build huge houses, create a boat and visit other islands.\nI won't tell all my adventures in the game, just give it a try yourself.  :-)   And beware of tigers!\nWhat I find to be very positive with this game, is how the developers are active in the forum or reacting on email-feedback given to them. I got quick responses and hints about possibilities which I have. In some other games I'm used to bugfixes taking months and the community is getting no or very late answers and information.\nOut of Reach is different: While playing, there might be a message that in five minutes the servers will go down - but ten minutes later I can continue playing. Some minor bugfixes are solved this way immediately. Bigger updates take low time to be downloaded, so playing is not \"waiting for hours\" but surprisingly I was back ingame quickly.\nI am also very pleased about the fact that so far I've never stumbled about a severe bug. This game is Early Access, so bugs and changes are to be expected often. I found minor bugs only and was pleased about the recent changes. For example, the implementation of Events with shipwrecks went smoothly. There was only one location where those wrecks appeared and we players could test whether it worked as intended. It did, at least for me. The locations for shipwrecks will soon be spread over the whole map.\nExactly this behavior of the developers pleases me. We can test and give feedback and it will be taken into account before spreading it map-wide. This is how I love it.\nSo, developers, please continue with this good work, all my thumps up for this! And players, dare it and test this game! I find it worth playing.\nHave fun!    :)\nedit: corrected a typo (exe = axe)", "hours": 205.4, "user_id": "76561198052285043", "username": "Auakopf", "products": 39, "found_helpful": 20, "early_access": true}

I mean it would be way wiser to put it that way because if people liked the game they would be happy to support it. In addition to that, a bigger player base would be established because right now the game is suffering from an extremely low player count. Look at this if you don't believe me:\n\nThe matchmaking takes literally forever in the region where I am currently living in (Oceania) and which is starting to get very irritating for me and a lot of other players. Sure, the other regions only take 2-3 minutes to find a match but you will constantly be playing with the same old people over and over again. No matter how good the game may be, if there is no decent player base to support the game, it will surely, soon enough, come to an end.\nI already considered the fact that the game will become a F2P in the next few months, but on the other hand, if the trend of the player count continues this way (declining from the looks of it), the game will surely fade out and die.\nTo original DL players: DL: BB itself is not a bad game at all, however, there is nothing new or fresh about it at all, it is simply the same old DL. The game is basically the original DL + BR, adding the so-called sampling and levelling system, lumping 12 Cranes together to eliminate each other. Not to mention the similarities of the interface from the old DL which we might as well call it a carbon copy and the reuse of engine and map.\nI was probably over expecting from DL: BB as a DL player.\nEssentially, if we look at the game in from the BR aspect or let's say the aspects of the people who have never played DL, the game has one of the most interesting combat mechanics and gameplay blended in from the original DL game and I am sure that a lot of those people will love the game once they get into it.\nI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, especially DL players in its current state because there is nothing fresh or original to the concept of the game other than it becoming a mix of DL and BR. The playerbase trend is also going into decline according to the statistics I've noticed. However, it is for you to decide because, in the end, it might be worth it for some people and not worth it for some people, like me who refunded the game.\nP.S. You can wait for the game to become a F2P, but I wouldn't expect a decent player count if the trend declines this way.", "hours": 1.9, "username": "OrdinalSin", "products": 189, "found_helpful": 131, "found_funny": 6, "early_access": true}

Also, it seems that most of the people reviewing this game don't realize that, when fully released, this game will be absolutely free.\nDo NOT buy this game unless you 1) wish to support the developers and 2) understand that it's early access and that there will be flaws.\nThat being said, the game is entertaining so far. My biggest problem is that there's only one map. The map is always the same and the hives are always in the same location, so the lack of randomization makes each consecutive game you play feel more and more stale. In my personal opinion, although this is a PvP game, I feel that zombies should have a bigger role. They're only around hives and otherwise are no threat at all.\nPROS:\n- Fluid parkour makes for some intense chases\n- Satisfaction you get in every battle royale game from getting a kil\n- Entertaining\n- Honestly the warm-up phase of the game is the best part\nCONS:\n- Can get old fast\n- Okay combat\n- Big hives are more a waste of time than anything", "hours": 31.3, "user_id": "76561198051843601", "username": "Kalaster1 [The Law]", "products": 132, "early_access": true}

{"product_id": "766370", "page": 29, "page_order": 5, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-09-18", "text": "My thoughts so far:\nHaving been a massive fan of the initial game, and completing The Following twice, it can be said that I enjoy the core mechanics of the game, however there are a few positive and a few negatives that I would like to hit upon after roughly 12 hours of playing.\nFirst and foremost, to address the elephant in the room is it fun?\nIf you enjoyed the first games, you enjoy the way the combat works and enjoy the way the movement works then yes, its absolutely fun. The way I'd like to describe it is as if you are playing co-op with a bunch of friends that you have annoyed, and they are trying to kill you.\nI will now go into slightly more detail about the positives and the negatives of the game.\nThe Positives:\n-The infested Haran has an absolutely stunning atmosphere, everything form the small shops that have been busted open, to infested barracks filed with zombies trying to gnaw your face off, it makes you feel as though that's exactly what the world would look like should we be plagued by a zombie virus. Absolutely phenomenal.\n-The sound design in this game if you own a decent headset is also astounding. Most of the time you will not be able to see the players, but rather you'll be able to hear a big zombie (a Demolisher or a Goon) attack them. Or you'll be able to hear a clumsier newbie screw up a jump and fall flat on his chest, making a ton of noise, prompting you to chase them down and murder for their sweet sweet samples.\n-The guns are just scarce enough. If you've played the original game you will most likely know that the guns in Dying Light are absolutely devastating. In Bad Blood the only place where you can get a gun is in a supply drop. And even when you do get one, it will have one clip worth of bullets, which makes you save them up until the point where you need them, or if you miss, it could be the reason you die.\n- The Variety of weapons is great. They are divided into 3 categories: Gun, Heavy, and Light. With each category having different subsets such as slicing/crushing weapons (hammer vs. scythe for example) This makes you thing carefully before picking up a weapon since your inventory space is limited and having too many of one weapon can often lead to your downfall.\nSo far ive been outlining the positives, and now ill address the negatives:\n-First and foremost, despite the variety of weapons, the balance is off here's why:\n-Shields are currently too strong. If a player were to spam his shield, you can't break through it, and frankly, if it does not exhaust your stamina bar, then you could potentially sit there forever. The shield can be broken with a heavy attack, but he can just spam block.\n-Bleed effects being guaranteed for some weapons can get annoying. Bleed ticks for one damage and it hurts like hell. If you chose the risky play, and you get hit by a arrow or a axe, you'd have to stop and cancel the bleeding. However stopping will often mean that you will die by the enemy that is charging at you with a Kukri with Electric mod on it\n-Another issue that I personally found was the fact that at times games randomly closed, now naturally please keep in mind that this is still early stage of development and issues are to be expected.\n-In a similar fashion to the previous comment, the player base is still small, so should you pick this up, at times you will have to wait a relatively long time before getting into a game.\n-I feel like one type of mod is missing. Sure the bleed mod exists, but  in order to have a complete set a poison mod would be incredible, rather than dealing slow ticking damage (or dealing damage once every few ticks) it should slow down players. Or, make it rarer than the frost mod and have it do both!\nNow, after all that being said here's my BIGGEST issues with the game thus far:\nHOW RANDOM THE SPAWNS ARE. There are two types of spawns, cushion spawns, and non cushioned spawns. Should you spawn on the latter, and you don't manage to hit your roll on time (which most players don't even know is a mechanic) you will be starting at a roughly 13 health disadvantage, its not much, its just annoying. And yes, after your first hive you will level up and get healed, however till you get there, you'd probably be able to take one less hit which might be just as much as you'd need to kill someone.\nTl;DR - Not for everyone, if you love the initial games, youll like this. Personally I look forward to more players, more updates and more coverage, ill do whatever I can to help out as small as my contribution may be.\nP.s.

I would have much rather preferred an update to the 'be the zombie' game mode in your good game, Tech.

You are then dragged into a match with 12 other people, into a small world, you must find a weapon, upgrade them, gadgets (Health, mines, daggers etc) then find the samples to extract, which can be found on the big goons, other players or by getting the samples located on the map, once you have that, you must extract! Simple, but when other players are hunting you!\nNow, the game, the store is expensive! To get a skin you need a lot of coins, otherwise you need ingame currency, again nothing worth buying but this is brand new, so this is expected and will progress overtime!\nOvertime I am sure more skins and options will become available!\nThere is no duo, squad or anything like that, so sadly you are alone in a game! - This is a die hard must!\nWould I recommend this game?

If you ever enjoyed that game for even a second, you will have a blast with this game.\nI literally just played for a few hours after downloading, won a few games, and it was extremely satisfying. I don't see the combat getting old. Also, the game runs like a charm, even on my crappy 4 year old quad core and on a GTX 1050 video card I get well above 30 fps, though I wasn't actively counting.\nThe parkour mechanics are also polished as hell.

Luckily, lowering the view distance greatly decreases this problem, and isn't an issue in this game.\n- some players are greatly laggy and can teleport around the screen, the said lag often messes with hit detection, or appears to, which results in cheap deaths\n- the spectator camera is zoomed into the other players's backs for some reason. Why isn't it zoomed out so we can see more of what's happening like in Overwatch, H1Z1, etc.? Also, why can't we rotate the spectator camera?\n- there is no easy-to-use TAB function to check the scores and see who's left alive\nCORE PROBLEM WITH THE GAME:\nAt the moment I write this, I've only been playing this game for about 4 hours, and I kinda feel like I've seen everything it has to offer. There's only one map, and it's copy/pasted from the Dying Light city map, and it's rather small and you'll be familiar with it after a couple hours of play.\nLikewise, there are lots of melee weapons, but they only really differ in speed/damage. There are about 10 extra items you can use (grenades, molotovs, mines, shields, medkits, etc.), and there's really not much space to experiment there. Finally, every match follows a set trajectory, with the player spawning, finding a weapon, then trying to gather samples while being on the lookout for other players. At the end, there's a fight at the chopper spot, and that's it.\nDon't get me wrong, this is pretty fun. However, it's still just one game mode, and in this case it's the only game mode. It's the as if Overwatch came out with only the Payload game mode, or as if CS:GO didn't have any mode except Plant the Bomb. Even PUBG and Fortnite have solo, duos, and teams game modes. PUBG and Fortnite also have much bigger maps and many more players, which greatly adds to the variety of every match.\nWhat I'm trying to say is, Dying Light Bad Blood needs more game modes, more maps, and more wacky additons to the game to keep it fresh even after many hours of play. Here are a couple ideas off the top of my head:\n- obviouisly, we could use a team mode with higher player counts\n- make a mode/mechanic where dead players can come back (once per match) as fast zombies (faster than human characters) who drop samples if killed, but can also get account XP/game currency if they manage to take down other players\n- make a humans vs zombies game where one team controls the zombies of various types and tries to stop the human team from gathering the samples and leaving the map\n- have random in-game events like a bunch of fast zombies spawning and chasing the players, or\n- co-op mode where players defend a base from waves of zombies, shouldn't be hard to do since you already have all the Dying Light guns anyway\n- deathmatch mode similar to the waiting room for the standard mode, so players can practice their close combat skills against each other in peace\nTLDR: Good game but it only has one mode and not much variety, so that might get boring fast.", "hours": 7.0, "compensation": "Product received for free", "username": "Giga", "products": 77, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

Below is what I wrote before I realized that.\nI took down the first boss of this game so far. Being a fan of old school shooters, I definitely like this game. It's very reminiscent of Hexen II, which was also a good game. However, unlike Hexen and Hexen II, there appears to be more emphasis on the action instead of exploration and puzzle-solving, which I like. It feels more like the original Quake.\nThe levels strike a good balance between being overly linear and too complex. It's complex enough that there's some room for exploration and a sense of vastness, but not so complex that you are always getting lost. The artwork is also quite interesting, using lots of bright colors and pixelated polygonal graphics, yet maintaining a somewhat dark atmosphere. The weapons are fun to use, and killing the enemies with them are generally satisfying, especially when you get the Legendary Soul powerups.\nThat being said, the game is not particularly innovative. There's really nothing here that previous games haven't done. However, it is still a breath of fresh air, and in my opinion worth a purchase if you're looking for some fast-paced action.\nIf 10 is a ground breaking masterpiece and 5 is average, then I will say this game hovers around 8/10. It is not a masterpiece, but it's a good time.\nEDIT 2: I've finished what's available on Evil difficulty, and my overall opinion is generally the same. There's a nice variety in enemies available.

The enemies are really interesting and keep you on your toes all the time. All in all a good game.\nNow, since it has \"open ended\" level designs- every now and then I find myslef looping around the same few corridors. Perhaps that's just me being a noob though.

Another game this good, is ARK Survival, though it is geared more towards the team players. Even its private server is not for the solo player. But OoR is da bomb!\nThings I love:\n1. So many things to build, including boats and gliders.\n2. So realistic.\n3. Can easily build a food source right off the bat.\nThere are a few issues that need to be dealt with:\n1. The berry bushes and corn bushes are too far and few between, and the corn on the stalks should be made bigger so more easily seen. The same goes for the flax. The flax grows in the tall grass and is VERY hard to see as the flower is so small and lightly colored. I pass it up all of the time.\n2. I love the map clouding and unclouding as the player explores the areas. However, the cave mapping needs to be much better. I have gotten lost because I cannot move the map around. so I can find my way back out the way I came in.\n3.There is always announcements of a trading vessel arriving, and I have NEVER found it. There is nothing on the map to show where he is.\n4. Needs more variety of animals. How about rabbits? I know this is more African plains based, but there are rabbits in Africa. How about jungle animals in the jungle areas?\n5. To make more realistic, add thirst. There are waterskins, after all. And how about defication to use as fertilizer? How about adding flint? Maybe wheat?\n6. Need to add sails for the boats to the building list. Linen is one of the products after all. The method to move them really sucks as it is geared for for team play. This IS a shipwrecked survivor scenario is it not?\nThis game is very enjoyable.

Other than that, the parkour itself feels exactly the same as before, and it's just as thrilling when you run into a massive hoarde by accident!\nOne other thing that I found to be somewhat of a pain is matchmaking. It was slow to find a game, but it's to be expected with a game that's just been released, as there won't be too many players online. If your friends also grab this game, you'll be able to test out the PvPvE in some matches!\nThe player customisation adds nicely to the game, and you can mix-and-match your clothes for you own unique style.

For example; the scenery is beautiful and the game mechanics are great. What I hope in future is that there will be better populated servers either by removing a couple of the official ones, or by more popularity of the game, and there will be more different maps.\nWhat I certainly do not like, even though its an early access game is the tremendously bad fps (20-40fps regardless if I put it to low or extreme quality, with 1080ti on a fiber connection) and server lag. Remove servers!! fix the connection issues!\nWhat I understand because its an early access is the balancing issues and to be fair they already fixed a couple of them (like being able to raid doors with simple arrows in <2 mins). If you ask about that, the devs answer that people are supposed to use Sledgehammers and Dynamite, but when I come back after <1 hour, a SOLO player raided Timber 10 doors with each 2400hp and was emptying my base... He claimed governor for a min, grabbed all the Steel Katana's and used it to raid my base. Anyone can do that over and over again. Same with the Presidency, you get a free cannon. I've seen bases with 12 cannon's easily and not more cause people don't want to go over the whole hassle again.\nAlso ffs fix the tobacco pipe issue. You know it's there, how hard is it to set the price to $0,68 instead of the $68,00 it is now making people setup factories of craft benches, crafting dozens of pipes making tens of thousands of dollars per hour. You are killing your own game with this. People that experience end-game won't play the game no longer!\nFor now I do not recommend the game but I do recommend the experience of looking around and see whats in store... for later.. buy it while its cheap.\n[EDIT] Played again with Alpha 9 & 10, but alas; Got raided through 20 doors on a base that took 3 days to build.

It seems like the game was not made for a high fov even though the option to set it that high exists.  With such a high fov you can look though walls without any problem at all. But i ignored it and thought that they just focused on more important stuff during development. The next thing i noticed is that it is impossible to swim if you cannot hold a button to jump, which meant that i had to rebind it again.\nAnother thing that bothered me was the graphic. I like the style but it kinda gave me a headache. The Pixelation made it hard to spot stuff and it only helped in dark areas to turn the brightness up. It took me about 25 minutes to beat the first map, just because i did not understand that you can shoot the buttons. I later did find the text, but after 15 minutes i kinda got bored of searching without anything happening.\nI dont know if it is just me, but i dont really feel like the movement is as precise at it could be. I often had problem navigating though a level,  which could also be partly the fault of the grapic style.\nThe enounters with enemies are too short and the are hard to identify quickly. After beating the first map i realized that i have no clue what any enemie does. I just remembered a big one flying and many colorful small ones. I will blame the grapic style for that cause in other games, for example DUSK, i never had the problem to identify an enemy from far away.\nOverall i still need to play it much more to give good detailed feedback, but maybe this small first impression will help you decide if you want to buy it.\nI still recommend this game, but the graphic style is kinda bothering me", "hours": 0.8, "username": "GLaD0S", "products": 364, "early_access": true}

You're supposed to level up to get those stats up, but the best part of the original game was being a parkour badass, flying across the place.  In this one, you get reset to a huffing parkour beginner every game, which isn't fun.\nPersonally, I think they should drop all the health levels (PvP and PvE) down significantly to make damage much more deadly.  That way you can mow through enemies and the PvP would be more frenetic.\nHopefully they'll fix the balance, because this game has SOOOOO much potential to be fun.", "hours": 0.8, "user_id": "76561197977679902", "username": "FortisVenaliter", "products": 570, "found_helpful": 61, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": true}

Unless you want to commit suicide of course.  As soon as you try to kill the zombie(s) for a character level up, you are garuanteed to be killed by another player who heard you making noise.  They will then level up from killing you, never to even look at a zombie.  Worse yet you will have low/no stamina and be injured when the PVP only player attacks becasue you were stupid enough to try and fight the zombies.\nWhy have them(zombies) in the map if they serve no purpose? At frist it would seem as if we are enticed to kill the zombies and level up lol. Like I said that is a suicidal move with very little payoff. Please remove the zombies if this is to be a battle royal game.  If it is to be an onjective based PVP/PVE battle royal game then please make the zombie killing worhwhile.  It needs to be easier(See Hunt Showdown) and more rewarding to engage in PVE combat. Have zombies spread throughout the map randomly instead of bunched up in certain spots.\n\nWhen I fight another player it lasts approx 20 seconds. But when I try and fight a low level zombie group it takes minutes of attacking, backing off to build stamina, attacking, backing off to build stamina..etc rinse and repeat for minutes on end.  And thats for the low level hordes.  Barely any reward for this, if you survive without getting stabbed in the back from a PVP only player of course. It is totally broken right now.\nI came for the PVE/PVP gameplay. I lleft becasue it comes down to PVP only, with the PVE massivly in the way of that. It is good at neither(PVP or PVE) and they do not blend at all in its current state.  High hopes dashed.  Back to Hunt Showdown. This is the culling with zombies unfortunately.

They fall into two categories 1) reviews where they talk about an alpha version .0001 no being optimized (seriously?) and 2) reviews where the reviewer did not play the game at all (they are typically talking about previous games from the same developer).\nIf you played Reign of Kings think of this game as RoK the next generation (writing this it's at alpha 4). The game has all the upsides of RoK while it seems to try to address all the old shortcomings. This has an ingame map (rok didn't), this has transportation (tamable horses etc., while rok you were 100% on foot), this adds a much more complex leveling system (rok had basically none), this has top of the line graphics (while RoK never had great graphics, but the style of the graphics on both games are very similar). In heat you can be the president, constable, governor etc.. (in RoK you could only be King). Heat added a money mechanic (RoK had resources only). Heat added an NPC mechanic whereas RoK had no such mechanic at all. Lastly on Heat they have all objects and interactions server side whereas on RoK they were unstoppable because it was client side. I have yet to see any hacker in Heat and it is clearly one of their design focuses.\nThere are some CON's too IMHO. The leveling system caused the game to be much more grindy than RoK and reduces the viability of Solo play. Clearly they are still adjusting this almost daily so perhaps solo play might be an option later. For instance to make anything beyond the most basic crafting you must level your character AND it charges resources to research the skill which makes creating an early protective base very difficult. They did add some simple base structures like a teepee etc. but I don't think this fully addresses the issue.\nThe loading issues that is widely reported is true but has improved. Even on my quite nice rig it still requires 6 minutes to load and as mentioned the frame rates (while also improving) are (as expected for an Alpha) not optimized.\nAnother CON is the high level of bugs. They are everywhere from solid objects you can walk through to objects on the ground that you can pick up but see an error to areas of the map where you can get stuck. In alpha4 I put a large stack of wood into a campfire and it exhausted like 100 wood in 10 seconds. So many bugs to be had.\nAll that said the game is clearly very fun and has the potential to become quite awesome. Well worth $20 and I imaging this game will be one of the best once it's all fleshed out.

Seriously, I don't even know where to begin with this, cause the developers managed to nail every aspect of this game head-on\nThe levels are unbelievable, each with it's own unique design and perspective, a multi-layered maze with paths twisting in and out of different areas that you might or might not have already been to. These paths you can take, some obvious, some not, combined with a multitude of secret areas, bring out a world that is just begging to be discovered.\nAnd you will be amazed, the style is genuinely beautiful. The graphics feel like a blend of the old with the new, a nostalgic mix that will appeal to both old and new comers to the gaming community. The game world as a whole however, is what I feel to be the true pinnacle of this game's aesthetic.\nEverything was built for a reason. Something built it, and the more you go around the levels, the more you start to question who, what and why. This bizarre yet attractive display helps build up a lore that's not in your face, but there if you pay attention to it, and the deeper you delve into this game, the more you'll be engulfed into it's universe.\nThe combat on the other hand, is pure adrenaline. Your enemies will be fast, brutal and numerous. They can hit as hard as you do, so you've got to be quick cause this game will show you no mercy. You'll have to start understanding how each unit fights, how fast your weapon is, and time each attack correctly. And you'll cuss at each one you miss, and panic when you realise how low your health is or your ammo, to the point that each pickup wwould look like a god-send.\nOverall, a good game if you're into action titles definitely, or just want a casual game to pick up at times. Even though it's in Early access, I've yet to encounter any bugs, it's pretty well optimized and in terms of content, there's 2 levels as of yet, with more yet to come.

It's a completely different game. The controls are a little different than dying light, but that's because there's no crafting and such and you can go change them to what you're comfortable with. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed dying light or even just those of you who like PvP games.

However for its purpose I have left this game a positive review only for its potential.\nI've personally been playing this game on average out of the 105 hours on record, about 50-70 of it. I say that because this game leaves me no choice sometimes to leave the game open over night so I can have a smooth transition to joining a server when I wanna play the next day. So I guess I can say I qualify to leave an actual review rather than ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this game like some ppl. However I understand what this Dev team has done in the past I've been there with Reign Of Kings.\nAs a person who deeply loves survival games I can say this game has a lot of potential because of the idea of it. It's an amazing concept for a game and can be executed perfectly if done right. However with this games current state I cant say I'd recommend to someone to buy if they don't have patients for a Buggy, Unbalance, Never ending Grindy game.\nHeat has many issues right now being that my most aggravating thing is the loading times. I have a really good computer in opinion\nand I have this game on an SSD. On average this game take roughly 5-15 minutes to load for me. On the side note there are many bugs I've reported like for example [ World Not properly loading when joining, causing the player to fall through the world and getting stuck in a finalizing menu... Or even game crashes almost consistently for many reason or randomly. ] If you really wanna know all the bugs the player base has experience since there is so many go look at the Bugs Discussion page [ @Devs ]\nNow don't get me wrong the Devs have been good so far with pushing out Patches and ignoring all the hate but they need to be transparent which they aren't and acknowledge their fans/community. I suggest that they make a forum page or actually use their website, or even make a discord since its free and easy for everyone. The developers need to listen to us and be communicative in order to allow their project to survive.\nAlso I say this game is grindy af... Only because of 3 reasons\n1) Unlocking next tier items require you to have the resources to unlock + sometime in game currency. fore those who never player wouldn't understand the grind you need to put in even as a solo player just to unlock an item, also being that you need double that resource requirement just to unlock then craft [Terrible]\n- [Solution] Allowing the players to either simply unlock the item immediately when leveling up will be perfect or just making the resource requirement a fraction of its cost to unlock would be okay. Anything but what is currently implemented is better!\n2) Crafting Times / Level Up Time /  NPC Maturation Time / etc... all take FOREVER on average you spend around 20mins - 3hrs of your actual time crafting 1 item, trying to level up, or even 10 years of your life to grow up your family. Sometimes I think the Devs didn't play test this game one bit. Now I get it, its a \"Hard core\" survival game but these are just some of the things no one wants to waste their time on. Having downtime like this just draws players away.\n3) This game is incredibly Unbalanced.. but yet.. still fun? I say its unbalanced because 1 major reason is that anyone can easily go to the presidents / governor / sheriff's office and get end game loot from their Provision Boxes or whatever which normally would take someone over a week to actually obtain themselves. Also these item respawn frequently allowing anyone to get an unlimited supply of these items. Granted you cant sell them but you can use these items like for example \"Steel Sledgehammer - 17 base damage\" to easily raid anyone on the server within 20mins by breaking in there doors. You also get an ungodly amount of weapons and ammo, making it not worth to unlock them yourself... I personally was able to use 5 sledge hammers to break in a fully Stone Upgraded Base with Timber doors and steal over 15k $$ plus 6 children and an insane amount of resources within 30mins. I felt bad for this person because I can imagine the grind it could've taken him/her. This kinda stuff needs to be fixed an I can go on about how to do it. but I'm gonna leave that up to the @Devs to ask me since its a slim chance they'll see this post.\nNow there is so many more things I can rant about this game but in the end its still a really fun game to play with a group a friends or randoms. It also has a tone of potential if the Devs can stick through this and listen to us and just maybe even read this post. I think a lot of this games issue could be solved and shape up a really enjoyable game for everyone.", "hours": 105.9, "username": "AJ", "products": 86, "found_helpful": 5, "early_access": true}

There is a truck load of content that makes you want to grind through all the different research/building trees. Whilst it is a good start and an extremely fun concept, there is a lot of work that needs to be done and I do not think CodeHatch will want to invest the time or the energy.\nSo what makes me say this? Firstly, I wanted to give them \"another go\" after the whole Starforge and RoK saga. I was willing to believe in what one of their devs posted that they have \"learned from their mistakes\", but in reality they haven't. Or at least, they appear to have not.\nWhy do I say this? Well, firstly community interactivity. You want to feel like you are actually apart of the Early Access cycle. Most companies have realised the importance of communicating with their community, with the establishment of dedicated community managers, official Discord's, live streams showcasing content, marketing/PR, constant communication on forums etc.\nI can say that CodeHatch, as of this particular moment, do nothing more then acknowledge 10 bug reports per day and that's it.\nThe most frustrating part of all this, is that there are several game breaking mechanics in the game, especially the economy, that could have been quickly fixed by the simple change of a price that can be sold in the economy. Yet, they have not done so. Economies and servers have been quickly ruined and legitimate players stooged.\nWhilst this is an Early Access title, CodeHatch would do well to increase their reputation by hiring a dedicated community manager who can help harness trust/investigate issues as they occur and give us someone to speak too. It is already apparent that Heat has nowhere near the early attraction that RoK had. Which is a shame as I feel that the actual gameplay is fun, albeit a lot of work needs to go in to it.\nI will revisit my review if CodeHatch decide to employ or dedicate better community tools to involve us in the Early Access process, as well as prioritising game breaking bugs that should be fixed swiftly...", "hours": 97.0, "user_id": "76561198085618179", "username": "Sophia Petrillo", "products": 61, "found_helpful": 28, "early_access": true}

You spend 90% of your time running in a straight line, or staring at the floor looking for items. Not this one. Literally every second of this game, from spawn to finish, keeps you engaged. The PvE content really sets it apart; for once, in a game of this genre, pve+melee combat is actually enjoyable, not a clunky mess (though pvp melee could use some work; I dislike the idea that it's essentially just RPS). Dying light's signature parkour adds a ton of spice to the mix; people complain about other's running away, but 9/10 I have been able to catch runners. Just read where they're trying to go and beat them to it or throw something at them. People also complain about the 12 person max; this game would not work with more people, and more people wouldn't make it more fun. Stop trying to make it something it isn't. If it makes you feel better to call this a 1-life FFA/deathmatch with objectives, then think about it that way. But disliking a game for not trying to be something it isn't is completely unwarranted, and just childish.

XD\nGraphics : 7/10 I Feel that the game world itself is amazing, realistic forests, rivers and mountains. Overall textures on clothing, animals and players is shoddy at best however.\nGameplay : 5/10 At the moment, the game is plagued with exploits (like lock picking being too powerful, land claim being poorly utilized, weight system not working so you can carry infinite weight, etc) Movement and fighting feels okay, but needs work. The jumping is silly XD\nDifficulty : 9/10 The grind is real. Earning XP and building a house is tough and if you pick an area with low resources, you'll have a bad time. Not to mention many Rust players frequent the game so PK'ing is rampant. Brings me to my next section.\nCommunity : 3/10 Haven't met a friendly player yet who doesn't just shoot and loot first, even if you're a fresh spawn. Chat isn't bad but good luck meeting people. Small servers and large maps make it tough to meet people and the few chances you get are hostile.\nWorld Size : 9/10 For an alpha, the game world is huge! Lot's to explore but towns could be expanded on. Too big for the current population cap of 32 on a server.\nOverall : Personally I'd go 50/50.

Seriously bad mechanics at work here.\nFirstly, all important resources are isolated in very centralized locations, without any way to get them but the SINGULAR location that they're in.  This lets players who are more established conquer the entire area and refuse to allow others in.  The 'quest' system is pathetic, including instructions such as 'go find a cave' which would have been great, if there were more than one cave that you should really just wiki the location of.  The graphics were pitiful, and then to top it off, when you do finally get a boat, the thing is a chore to drive.  Kind of funny, kind of fun, for the first 30 seconds, but then if you try to go anywhere in it, don't bother.  You can swim to any major island you need to and if an island DOES have valuable resources on it, don't bother fighting with the miserable little boat to get there, it's already been claimed and built over so heavily that you've got no chance to get on it even if you do get there.  The combat system was absurd, to say the least, dramatically favoring anyone who has had the chance to get those resources (that they've blocked you off from), and at its best being able to be described as 'clunky'.  The building system had a few good points, but so often the piece wouldn't allow you to place without any explanation as to why, making anything more than a derpy square shack to be rather frustrating to construct.\nNow, if you're looking for a laugh, feel free.  Spent about 6 hours on the game being ridiculous with a friend.  He modeled his character after Saitama from the Onepunch Man series, which was a crackup the whole way through.

Battle Royal is not usually my cup of tea with me not enjoying both Fortnite and PUBG, I am however a fan of the concept. Dying Light: Bad Blood successfully combines the success of the games combat and parkour with the heart-pumping gamemode we all know as Battle Royal. An odd combination on the surface but the outcome is amazing. The combination of PVP and PVE makes the game feel unique amongst a quite crowded genre.\nGameplay wise, it is definitly unique amounst other Battle Royal games. Summarised, you need to:\nGet blood samples from zombie nests (or from other killed players)\nMeet at a Helicopter evac point once your samples are sufficient for evacuation\nKill all other players who try to attempt the same goals.\nThe gameplay has you constantly monitoring your surroundings as nests are usual gather points for lots of players making for some intense battles. The combat abilities from the base game also assist you in performing special combos on other players making for some pretty sick takedowns. The final fight for the helicopter is also rather intense, the area for the evac is rather small, compressing all contenders together into a small arena. Overall the gameplay for DLBB is successful and will compete well against other BR titles.\nNow the price... If your like me and you largely enjoyed the base game then you will get your monies worth, however if your coming from other Battle Royal games and you have no Dying Light experience then this is going to be a massive learning curve for you and the title may seem overpriced. Luckily its just the founder edition and your free to wait until its full, free release.\nOverall, great game! Love Techland's dedication to their games and I am looking forward its future development and full release.

Of course things have to be optimized and balanced in order to improve the experience but that´s what´s early acces is for.\nI´m for sure getting my money worth as of now. However I can only recommend this game to people that like PVP with no rules unless you go on a community roleplay server. On the official servers you have to expect to be raided especially while you´re offline and you should be aware of that.

A quality game through and through, a dedicated team of developers, and not -just- a rehash of old games, AMID EVIL kicks it oldschool, while also understanding that our expectations for our games have evolved somewhat over the years.\nThe level design in the campaign can occasionally be confusing, but is always top-notch in not only the function of providing a play area to explore and fight in, but also in looking beautiful in its detail, and hiding its secrets well enough to keep you in each stage a little longer hunting for areas and rooms you might have missed.\nWhen you tire of the campaign (which is already long enough to provide several hours of entertainment, with more chapters in the works during this Early Access period) you can take a break seeing what kind of a score you can rack up in the wave-based endless survival mode.. a relatively simple, but fun way to enjoy some pure combat.\nThere is a fine variety of weapons, each with their own purpose in combat situations.. there's even one that flings planets at your enemies to deal explosive damage.  Commit genocide by using the earth itself to destroy a rock golem!  Collect enough souls from your fallen enemies to activate extra-powerful attacks until you run out of energy... my only wish is that perhaps you could choose when to unleash your soul energy, rather than it happening automatically the next time you fire any weapon.\nThe game may look like Hexen or Heretic on the surface, with its magic-based weapons.. but if I were to compare the actual feeling of playing and controling the character, as well as the hub-style of navigating the difficulty options and chapters, I would compare this most to Quake 1, but maybe a little slower.  No complaints here, it plays wonderfully!\nAnyway, if you're on the fence about this game, consider this my recommendation to take the plunge.  If you don't like Early Access, and expect to have the full campaign when you purchase the game, wishlist it for now, and check back later.  Either way, it's definitely worth keeping an eye on this one if you like a nice action-packed FPS with oldschool roots.", "hours": 4.6, "username": "Carlz0r", "products": 2159, "found_helpful": 5, "early_access": true}

Borrowing heavily from the golden age of FPS's, Amid Evil boasts stunning retro-modern visuals, tight gameplay, and impressive atmosphere.\nFor anybody who waxes nostalgic about the days of Quake and Heretic, you should already be downloading this.  For those of the younger gaming generation, you should already be downloading this as a lesson in what made those games iconic.  A disciple of the \"shooting on rollerblades\" speed of classic FPS's, Amid Evil is almost jarringly fast paced, but is far from unweildly.  Even in the most crowded fights, I felt that I had significant agency and control.  The weapons are similarly fine tuned and exceedingly creative.  If you don't grin ear-to-ear when impaling enemies to a wall with a crystalline mace or blowing them to bits with a literal projectile planet (you read that correctly), I don't want to be your friend.\nThe visuals tow a fine line between the pixelized standard of yore and the enhanced lighting and shading effects offered by the Unreal engine.  The results are difficult to describe and absolutely stunning in motion.  More than once, I had to stop and gaze at my technicolor surroundings - something I can't say about most games with more realistic fare.  The level design itself is an innovative mix of the first Unreal's saturated color pallete, Doom's alien aesthetic, and Quake's gothic architecture.  It truly melds into something unique and appealing.  Similarly, the music hits precisely the right chords (no pun intended) for those who remember the games of that age.\nThis is my first review on Steam, and I couldnt think of a more appropriate game for which to write it.  Amid Evil is important in the current game climate and deserves your support.  You will not regret purchasing this.  I appreciate a good narrative as much as the next gamer, but game developers really need to take a good, hard look at gameplay and atmosphere again.

There were disconnecting problems on launch that are fixed now, And I do feel some balancing needs to be added. Mostly with how you get levels and the guns in the game. One big problem is the fact that they are charging for this game. I have no problems with this because Techland has been making tons of free updates for Dying Light for a long time. However due to Steam’s Store page being a sea of trash and the tidal wave of Battle Royale games being flooded on the market, charging people to play a beta is not going to get the game a fanbase, and will kill the game in the long run. You only get one chance to make an impression when your game launches and if it messes up, your game will die. Honestly if any of the devs read this, the solution in the long run to get an established player base at this point is to have Free to Play weekends where the game is free for a couple of days. Otherwise this game will die. Not because it is bad, because no one will give it attention, and I am already worried this game won’t do well due to the price tag and all the other games that recently released taking the spotlight off it.\nWith that out of the way though, this game is fun. It’s fun because it isn’t like other Battle Royale games. It actually brings something new to the table for once, and reminds me more of the original Culling game but better. It’s a lot more colorful than the first Dying Light, and with some tweaks and balances can make a really fun game. You sort of die very fast so that needs to be addressed because that will annoy players. Potentially getting a second life but losing levels or gear when you die may help. Other small changes such as maybe instead of standing on the extract point for 25 seconds to win, you get a rope the helicopter throws down and and slowly pulls you up with to win while you defend yourself. With this game in Beta, I do hope the devs are careful with what they do, and are very VERY careful with any micro transactions they may add to the game when it gets out of Early Access, or else they will re-create the consumer backlash that ruined PUBG but on a much smaller scale which is even more lethal when you don’t have as many players.", "hours": 1.0, "username": "Ƥyrefeather", "products": 395, "found_helpful": 120, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": true}

This game is basically a more polished Battle Royale version of that game. Instead of being like PUBG or Fortnite, two of the largest Battle Royale games out right now, this game changes up the genre by adding in a second factor: NPC's & Zombies.\nI won't bore you with the details of how all of this works, but let me say I have had some serious fun even though I've only spent a couple hours in the game so far. I've convinced a friend of mine to buy it, and we'll be playing together. It's not the hardest thing to get into a game with a friend, and there is a special gametype to do it, but there really is no black and white \"duos\" option yet in this game.\nOverall? I'd rate the game 8/10, and the missing 2/10 is purely for the fact that this is an early access game, and also for the fact that it should probably be $12.99 or $14.99 instead of $19.99, but I do understand that to a degree they're sort of raising funds for the development of the game by opening it in a sort of expensive early access state.

The land is huge and some areas just dont have mining nodes around. The forest and land biome u walk through are beautiful. Lots of land to see and walking takes a very long time to get across map. The wild animals will attack but only if u get too close. There mechanics look off some times. It takes quite a while to harvest animals but u do get a good bit for it.  When cooking it you dont have very much room in the fires.  Farming is pretty simple and straight foward. It's easy to do and take care of. Building base is easy as long as the land is cleared our properly. Overall it's a good game.

The game TRIES to be realistic, but fails in MANY areas. For 1, you can run up a mountain & not lose any stamina, but run along a flat terrain & you'll lose stamina. You'd figure that since you can cut down trees with a broken rock, that you can use pretty much any tool - nope. Say you have a pick axe, it clearly looks more better than the rock & clearly has a better blade on it than the blunt rock you start with, but the game will say \"You need a proper tool\" an you'll be wondering \"Since when is a rock a proper tool for cutting down trees?\"\nPros:\n- Build stuff\n- Craft stuff\n- You can swim\n- You have a map\n- Best played with friends\nCons:\n- Gets boring REALLY fast\n- Everything degrades pretty rapidly\n- Working burns calories but doesn't burn stamina\n- \"Level up\" feels pointless as you have no actual stats that you can improve\n- Fire a Ballistae at a Tiger, he'll survive and end you\n- Online ONLY game, unless you have a computer powerful enough to run the world & you at the same time (like running the game twice)\nThere are far better games out there that just like this:\nThe Forest - very similar, except theres a point to it. Save your son from the cannibal tribesmen.\nProject Zomboid - also very similar, you can see your character from birds eye view, you have skills you can level up (and they do feel like level ups unlike OoR's level up system), yoou have zombies to worry about, and practically everything can kill you, including yourself (you could literally drink bleach in that game) and it's worth the $15.00 cause Devs actually do make VISIBLE improvements.\nArk Survival Evolved - 1st off, you need MUCH better than the minimum requirements displayed for this one. Optimization does need work, but beyond that if you can run it, you'll be experiencing Out of Reach with way better graphics, way better threats, way better level up system with actaul skills you can improve, you can create clans (just like in OoR), you can hunt the wild life (just in OoR), you can forage plant food (just like in OoR), you can tame dinosaurs & other wild life in order to use as mounts (unlike OoR), you can build bases that degrade over time (just like OoR), and you can run your own game (unlike OoR which requires way more to run your own - which is ridiculous).\nAnd even - Romero's Aftermath - this game is free to play, mostly. It does have microtransactions, but considering that its free & you don't have to pay in order to get ahead (seriously you don't), even this game is better than Out of Reach.\nIn Out of Reach, all you do is build up, gather stuff, make better stuff, hunt wild life, and ultimately just survive.\nIf just surviving was their end goal for this game, they succeeded, cause thats all you'll be doing.\nThe title does seem fitting, because the interest I have for this game is just Out of Reach.\nGet this game & I guarantee that you'll be regretting that decision.\nWhen I first played this in 2015, I was thinking a rating of 5/10 felt reasonably fair.\nBut 2 years later an the game looks the same, feels the same, almost like the Devs don't care anymore, I'm giving this a 2/10.

It has its flaws, flaws that seem like they're being worked on but flaws none-the-less. The load times are horrible, but is that really an issue? Yes the wait to get into the game is awful but the game itself isn't. The game is gorgeous even on low settings, there are some lighting rendering issues but that doesn't really impact the game itself, and are bound to be smoothed out as we head out of launch. A reminder, this game is barely a week into early access. Remember what Early Access means, and don't give me no crap about wanting a finished product, this is exactly what you paid for.\n20 dollars for this game is a good solid price,  but if you're stingy you can wait for an inevitable future sale. Everything takes a decent amount of time in this game, my advice is to host your own server with some friends and enjoy just working together. The NPC's aren't numerous as I had hoped, mainly because I don't find much enjoyment from PvP environments.\nThe world is decently vast, though finding each other will be difficult but really that gives everyone more time to build themselves up respectably. The whole claim system seems a bit redundant but gives the President a decent sway in server politics. Without a claim your buildings degrade overtime, I wish there was a feature to turn this off as playing privately we have no need for the claim system. The game is a hard minimum spec game, if you don't have at least 6gb of V-Ram you're gonna suffer frame wise, its good to have a higher end GPU for this game, but bare minimum I recommend a 1060 6gb.\nEverything is enjoyable, as long as you know what this game entails. This isn't a PvM game, it has PvM aspects but it is essentially a Rust-Meets-Ark wild west survival game. Roleplaying is probably a good place to enjoy the environment and the game as a whole.\nFrom what I've seen, the official servers are pretty friendly, and the chat is filled with helpful people just trying to learn the game.\nIf any of this interests you, pick the game up, regardless of what other people say.

Building upgrades also a hold down M1 simulator, how building works first you frame your building in sticks perfectly fine I actually like this then the second stage is adding actual defense to the structure like wood or stone you must hit the structure for about 3 or 4minutes to add the wood or stone to each wall... Hopefully this gets changed it is extremely tedious.\n4. This could be a pro/con, but you can make a shipping/recieving bin which allows you to sell off excess resources for money, however the items go into the void of nonexistance in exchange for money that can be used to say buy the second best axe or pickaxe in the game or get a material you just actually can't find on your own.\n*BIG CON*\nThis game uses a prehistoric method to load in new areas. Let me explain, have you ever played grand theft auto 3 or Vice city? Remember when you went to the next city you would eventually get a loading screen mid play. This is in this game unfortunately at a higher frequency than gta. My advice put this game on a ssd if you get it for the time being.\nLastly there is something else which is server saves every 15minutes the servers save which is fine, however the saves pause you on the spot until it is finished with the save this must be changed this is prehistoric aswell.\n*advice*\nDon't get me wrong I like the game it just needs a lot of fixing. If you are on the fence buy the game for 20$ it is worth that then if you wana make sure you don't waste 20$ wait until better reviews come out before you play 2hours so you can atleast get your 20$ back.", "hours": 21.8, "user_id": "76561198142812901", "username": "Pls No Booli", "products": 64, "early_access": true}

The PvP is good but people are mean and forget sometimes that it's good to play nice sometimes.

Good level architecture with some secrets and great atmosphere (awesome music). Each Episode has it's own world and setting. The Weapons are simple but useful like in the old days and that's what i like so much. By the way when the Player is getting a new weapon he laughes like \"Corvus\", a Sidhe Elve and the main Character of \"Heretic\". This is so cool. Now we need a world map between the levels for each episode like it was in Doom1 and Heretic and the game is perfect ;-p\nThe pixelated graphics looks so good and like in the old days it's a major influence for the great and mystical game atmosphere. For Example the Style of the World in Amid Evil (first episode) reminds me of the Water Palaces in Heretic (Episode 3) and there are so many more hints and links honoring the old games. The gameplay is a real fast \"run and gun\" gameplay, or should i say \"run and sorcery\" ;-)\nFor all those who want to play an oldschool shooter with great atmosphere, sorcery wands instead of firearms and liked the old games heretic and quake, this is the one to go.\nGet it now, this game is awesome!!!!", "hours": 43.9, "user_id": "76561198050178369", "username": "Agent Smith", "products": 471, "found_helpful": 2, "early_access": true}

Completing them again in EVIL.\n---\nEasily the best Heretic sequel we will ever get (Heretic II sucks, deal with it).\nGraphics: 8/10\nForced retro graphics on UE4 looks nice and runs well on GTX 1060. Weapons are skinned VERY NICELY (loving the Celestial Claw!) Only caveat is some textures look really bland and repetitive.\nLevel design: 7/10\nThe level design seems too focused on small skirmishes, which kinda breaks the action on some parts. Still fun, but could be better by adding more action on large areas. Maps can seem barren at times. Also, worldbuilding by blocks quickly loses its novelty after a few minutes.\nClever design on the difficulty select, though - finding the EVIL difficulty is pretty good, although there are secrets still being constructed by developers...\nWeapons: 9/10\nThe weapons are not only original - THEY'RE ACTUALLY FUN AND USEFUL. Depsite the ammo-sharing, you'll find uses for the weapons in most situations, and you'll find yourself switching more often. The Celestial Claw holds a place in my heart (blow up the earth for lols), as well as the Star of Torment (spiky mace thingy that launches spikes that impale enemies to walls). The game even has a Painkiller-esque souls that you collect to enter Soul Mode, which will power up your weapons for a short time (akin to Heretic's Tome of Power). The only reason it's not getting 10 points is the Trident thingy is... kind of useless really. And the BFG thingy. But other than that, it's golden!\nMovement: 10/10\nIt's fast. It's furious. It's got options to change your FOV, strafe tilting and movement bobbing. Most importantly you can rocket jump.

They are located in marked spots on the map, guarding \"nests\" which you need to get to and extract samples from to upgrade your health and stamina.\n4) All the while you are looking out for other players who can make easy sneak attacks on your position (always be looking around and moving).\n5) Eventually, when a few players are left, a helicopter icon will signal somewhere on the map and you will have to try to run to it.\n6) Only one player can leave on the helo, and in my one hour of playtime I've reached the helo only once, to be killed by a player who was three levels higher than me. Frustrating.\n7) There are no moments of boredom in this BR rendition. You are constantly parkouring around the map, looking out for enemies and new zombie nests to harvest for level ups.\n8) Although it's in early access, there is a shop where you can buy new clothes for your avatar and customized weapon paint schemes.

Another thing this game does better than ROK is base building. One of ROK biggest flaws was it tried to be like minecraft with its base building, which was easily exploitable and made most bases look horrible.

Crazy weapons, spectacular levels, lots of enemies.  A call back to FPS classic run-and-gun that's polished and precise.\nWhat this game is is kind of a Hexen/Heretic fusion, completely retro (even in some of the look), with some modern polish and a bit of a plot.  It delivers exactly what it says it does, so if that interests you, then go for it.  If you want more detail, read further.\nThe game follows the classic formula:\n* Enter areas from a hub.\n* Battle through assorted enemies.\n* Find assorted weapons, powerups.\n* Kill more enemies.\n* Find secrets.\n* Now and then fight a boss.\n* Start the next collection of levels.\nIn addition, there's a \"Soul Power\" mechanic.  You collect enemy souls and with enough you power up and temporarily your weapons all work differently.  Keep killing enemies and you keep going.\nOn top of all of this there's a horde mode for blasting away at enemies and seeing how long you can last.\nWhat the game gives you is the classic formula established long ago, with a few twists, and done very well.  The designers clearly knew exactly what they were aiming for and hit it perfectly.\nHowever as well done as the game is, the levels really stand out. Looming, strange, beautiful, eerie, the levels feel both surreal and solid, like some kind of painting some to life.  There are moments you just want to pause and appreciate the scenery.\nFor an Early Access game, AmidEvil clearly delivers -hearkening back decades ago, and with new levels being added over time.  The devs also listen to feedback!\nWho's this for?\n* If you loved the old fantasy shooters like Hexen and Heretic, you probably should just stop reading and buy this.\n* If you like retro FPSes you should strongly consider it.  It nails the classic formula.\n* If you want an FPS blast-fest that's straightforward.  I like RPG-like FPSes, but sometimes it's nice to just collect weapons and blow stuff up.\nI also have to recommend this game as - of all things - a relaxer.  Individual levels can be played in 5-15 minutes, so it's a good game for a quick break as well as hours of gameplay.", "hours": 13.6, "username": "GameDragonZero", "products": 125, "early_access": true}

There's also a staff that shoot homing projecticles, a bad a** starting AXE which can if you aim it right one shot weaker enemies by taking their heads off completetly which feels pretty satisfying and a couple of other surprises that you'll get to enjoy.\nThe game has a similar soul mechanic like from Painkiller, when you kill someone you get to pick up their soul, when you max out your soul meter all your weapons do increase damaged and get some cool new properties be it making some weapons get ricochet shots or in the planet launcher's case, it starts shooting suns at enemies. Only annoyance about this mechanic is the same annoyance Painkiller had, as soon as you max out the soul bar, the first shot you fire activates it so sometimes you might find yourself activating it at a time where there might be no enemies or very few left making it kinda go to waste, however activating it at the right time such as a boss fight can turn a boss into a complete joke which is probably why the developer doesn't let us simply have it be a seperate button to activate it.\nSo far the three chapters offered in the game are good with the first one being my favorite for now, each chapter offers a completetly unique environment,design and new enemies with new aesthetics designs that fit with each chapter. The developer put a good amount of effort of making each chapter feel very different which is great, however the enemies for an example don't feel all that different between chapters and the A.I. code for them is mostly to just run at a straight line towards you at a very fast speed and that's about it, even the range enemies will usually just keep slowly approaching you as they're shooting untill they get into close range to hit you, it's thus far about the only more major weakness of the game.\nI love the art style in the game, it's really darn unique i have to say. It does an odd and very visually pleasing combination of old and new type of graphics which gives the game a very strong visual identity to make it stand out from other games.\nOverall i'm enjoying it quiet a bit and made me quiet happy to play even more old school fps games made in the current year, it's not finished yet as its i believe suppose to have 7 chapters and atm there's only 3, still i strongly recommend picking it up for any fans of old school shooters who grew up with games like quake,heretic and duke 3d, you won't regret it.", "hours": 5.4, "username": "FuscusNight", "products": 483, "found_helpful": 2, "early_access": true}

Normally you could reasonably argue I'm over simplying this, but considering that's the only review they replied to, and they didn't actually talk about ANYTHING they're doing to fix these problems...is it really so far off?\nBut it's okay, they want us to stay tuned so that they'll add more content, maybe more garbage item skins, and probably some other stuff no one wants rather than fixing the game.

The game has a really good mix of PvM and PvP. The melee combat feels weighty and responsive. Movement is also very fluid making the act of running around and collecting gear kinda fun. Games are also short and action packed; they tend to end around the 10 minute mark. The max player count being 12 is a really smart move because it will ensure that games can still be filled up even if the player base gets smaller in the future.\nAt the time of writing, my main complaint is the guns. The guns are way too powerful and don't really seem to have a place in this game. While they are somewhat difficult to obtain because you have to get them from AI bandit camps, they just deal far too much damage. I was able to win a game against another player because I pulled out a shotgun mid way through the fight when he didn't expect it and nearly insta-killed him. I think the overall balance would be in a really good place if the guns were taken out of the game and replaced with perhaps a special utility item.\nEDIT: While I still enjoy the game, the metagame has become insanely annoying. Throwing your weapon at another player is the op meta strat and it's ruining the game. Thowing a rare weapon at another player without a shield at close range results in a stun and about 60-70 damage. It's kinda ruining the game. Blunt weapons shouldn't stun when thrown, the effect is way too good.", "hours": 14.2, "username": "Portalfreek", "products": 458, "early_access": true}

At the moment these bugs are still part of the game but with the updates over the last few days they are beginning to fade away.\nFrom my perspective 'Heat' is worth the money as long as the developers keep fixing the bugs at the rate they are doing as this will allow the game to quickly become more viable for the consumer to feel comfortable playing and enjoying. As I am writing this I have around 47h played and I feel like I can have an adequate answer to people considering purchasing this game.\nIf you are someone who is easily annoyed at little bugs that can make a game hard to play at times, this game is most likely not one you should be getting. On the other hand if you are able to overlook the current bugs and play the game how its intended to be played you can have some awesome moment even playing as a solo. Comparing this game to other's; obviously the previous game 'Reign of Kings' has similar gameplay links but this game is more relatable to that of 'Rust'. With the building mechanic and the sorts of things rust has to offer. Heat's game premis focuses on American history and gives the player the ability to become President, Governor, Sherif or the Native Americans. This creates some awesome RP (role play) scenarios and allows players to make choices that can affect people on the server.\nIn conclusion from my experience in the game, playing part as a solo player and with friends this game has great potential and in its current state can easily produce endless amounts of content.\nGot bored so though I would write this :)\nTy for reading!", "hours": 62.2, "username": "Jfour", "products": 147, "found_helpful": 22, "found_funny": 3, "early_access": true}

Bought it when on sale, definitely worth 7,50 euros. It's a survival game as you can imagine, and really piratey. The potential is huge and apparently they've been patching it, not sure how often, but they are working on it and the upcoming features look amazing. I'm pretty sure this game is gonna be better and better. There's also a raiding system that I really like because it limits griefing. Basically when you build a base you have to make a builder's desk to protect your building. The more you upgrade this desk, the longer it will take the enemies to raid your base. Basically once you destroy it, a countdown starts. As long as the countdown doesn't reach 0, the enemies cannot destroy or steal your stuff, but they can destroy doors and beds (respawn points).\nI think it is a really cool features because we are used to survival games that basically become your main job if you want to succeed and keep your base safe, and even if this is the situation, you are not certain you gonna preserve it.\nThis game may use some better animations and sound effects, but not a huge deal honestly. You can build small boats / rafts in order to sail and explore. There are caves to explore in which you find minerals such as copper and iron in order to make better tools, better armors, better equipment in general. The equipment can also be made of bone which can be harvested by hunting animals and using a hatchet on their dead body in order to gather it, along with fat (used for torches), hide (armor and other gear) and meat. You can also plant crops, such as corn, but also small plants for fiber and berries, and mushrooms as well.\nAnd, OMG, there are pirate clothing and weapons ^^. I like the environment. I actually needed something different and if this game gets more pirate stuff in the future, even better. Finally, something different (as far as I know).\nI'm looking forward for a lot of features, and also hope that more of what I got in my mind will be added to this game.\nCombat system is not bad. I actually like it. It's not as fast as it is in ARK, for example, and you can use different weapons and also shields in order to parry enemy attacks.\nOverall, the game is looking good and getting better, so it's worth a try in my opinion.

From superficial things like gold and silver keys and the difficult/level select hub, to a lot of the level design and a few of the subtlties about how combat plays out. And really, 'like quake' is about as high a praise as you can give an FPS.\nReally though, there's a lot of unique stuff in here. I'm not a huge fan of just listing off features in a review but some of the weapons in this are just great. Stuff like the sword, which is one of the few genuinely new in function weapons I've seen in an FPS in a long time. It seems like just a simple projectile at first, and somewhat underpowered, but once you realise that it still does most of its damage while passing through just fine when it grazes enemies you wind up trying to line up shots in a bunch of unique ways. The rest of the weapons are generally more generic, but pretty fun and unique from an aesthetic standpoint, like the shotgun/painkiller-stake-gun crossover that is the mace, or the BFG which shoots black holes in soul mode.\nOn the topic of soul mode, it's another of those things lots of people seem to be misunderstanding quite a lot. I hear a lot of people complaining that you can't save it for when you need it, but that's *exactly* what make it great; it's something you get really regularly, often enough that you don't need to save it, and forcing you to use it ensures it's common and gets you chasing down rushed, long lasting chains of it with stupid amounts of destruction as you blow through enemies.\nAlso I told the dev to make the spinning axe propel you through water as a meme and he actually did it, 10/10 best modern 3D fantasy shooter I've played.

{"product_id": "673130", "page": 45, "page_order": 9, "recommended": true, "date": "2018-03-14", "text": "So far I'm absolutely amazed by this game. At this point I've played through two episodes on AMID EVIL (max) difficulty. Some big positive points:\n+ Fantastic level design, I haven't seen such well designed levels since the good old days of doom/quake/duke nukem/unreal. The levels from the first two episodes feel like a mix of Heretic and Quake. The secrets in them are also really good, not too easy to find, but also not impossible if you look for them. The level design is arguably one of the best things about the game, for me at least.\n+ Great sounds, not kidding, really impressed with every single sound in this game. Very powerful sounds in general, but not to the point that they become overwhelming. Along with this, also really good music, similar in mood to Heretic but then slightly heavier.\n+ The general feel. Movement and scale-wise the game feels great, it's fun to hop around. The weapons generally feel good, especially the crystal mace thing is very satisfying to use. The ambience feels fantastic, mainly thanks to the above two points.\n+ Balance. If you use one weapon too much, you'll definitely run out of the type of mana that it needs at some point (also making you unable to use the other weapons that use that type of mana), so there's not an abundance of resources in the level to the point where it becomes trivial. Additionally, it seems that each weapon seems to have a specific use case, though some are slightly less frequently useful than others.\n+ Some of the enemy designs are very cool, though I also have some gripes here.\n+ Stability and performance is great, no problems here whatsoever. Configurability also seems just fine, I was able to tweak the game to my liking in  terms of sensitivities, FOV, crosshair, video settings, etc\nThere are some small things that I somewhat dislike though:\n- Somewhat simplistic in mechanics, compared to the older games at least. There's no inventory system and no armor. Heretic for instance had some very interesting inventory items that were fun to use, likewise with some of the other shooters. The \"mega\" items here also somewhat disappointing so far. The weapon arsenal, although really quite fun, also feels a bit limited, would love to see more weapons at some point (but not too many of course). All in all it feels that some depth is lost compared to those games.\n- It's annoying that the weapon powerup gets triggered by weapon fire, several times I had been forced to activate it because I wanted to shoot a shootable button. It also kinda prevents you from having fun with destroying the environment (statues etc), because you'd trigger it then, but this is a very minor issue of course.\n- Some of the enemies ruin the combat a bit, such as the very fast melee ones that home in on you and can attack from some very weird angles through the sharp turns they make (e.g. they walk off a staircase and then immediately zip towards you). The main problem here is that I would love to just pull out the axe and smack them in their face, but the axe doesn't seem to have much of an impact if you don't soften them up first, and they will ALWAYS hit you if you even attempt to do melee, so it's better to just +back and kill them like that, which is frankly a very boring thing to do. Some sort of stun effect from the axe would help here, I would love it if the axe became a bit more fun to use, I use it whenever possible/feasible (final blow, etc). Maybe I'm just a bit spoiled by the melee combat that was in the new shadow warrior games (1 and 2)\n- Not sure if it's just me, but the game feels a bit easy on the maximum difficulty (AMID EVIL difficulty). As long as you keep the melee enemies at range, there's basically no problem in dealing with all of them. The only difficulty arises from moving/anticipating things wrongly and getting cornered, or eating too many enemy projectiles, or getting cheeky and trying some melee which always gets punished.. Along with this the first boss is ridiculously easy, since he's so slow and barely shoots anything (seems to have a single attack), but I guess this is alright for a first boss anyway. But to put this differently: The game feels alright for me on this difficulty level on a first try, while in my opinion there should be even harder difficulty options for when one gets accustomed to the game.\n- The directional sound is frankly quite bad, but so far directional sound has been an issue in many of the UE4 games, including UT4 pre alpha itself, so I'm not sure if this is something that the game does wrong or an engine issue. I do have to say that pinpointing where some enemy sound comes from is difficult if they are nearby, especially if they are below you. But I think this is fixable.\nI have to stress that these are VERY minor gripes though, compared to the things I like about the game. The game is a GEM, anybody that's a fan of the legendary old school shooters (in particular quake and heretic) should definitely give it a try, and even if you do not know these games, you're in for one hell of a treat with this game if you like fast paced first-person shooters.

At first, I was confused; I expected a re-skin of Reign of Kings. It looks very similar, despite some graphical improvements, and plays very similar in terms of physics, quirks, and movement. But I could not be any more wrong, this game is very different from Reign of Kings, and in the best way possible.\nThe new mechanics CodeHatch have implemented completely change the game. There is a strong roleplaying element to the progress, which was a pleasant surprise. Building is entirely different, also a welcomed change. The core of the game is sound and very enjoyable to play.\nIt’s a survival game, of course it will be grindy. However, where with most games there is only one route to the next step, in Heat there are several for various playstyles and various levels of patience. Don’t want to farm wood for an hour? Go hunt down a bear and sell its pelt so you can afford to buy the wood instead. Don’t want to grind the money for a fancy new gun? Go test your aim against the townsfolk with your bow and arrow and loot your new weapon off them. Don’t want to interact with other players until you’re ready? The map is enormous! Go live in a crevice in a valley up north where there is little chance of anyone finding you or go nomadic with a teepee or tent and move every few days so no one can track you.\nWhy would I not recommend buying this wonderful game right now? CodeHatch is still working out the kinks. Many people expect a polished game for early access and that’s not what you’re getting at the moment. It runs hard on lower-end PCs. Hell, it doesn’t run that well on my GTX 1070. They’re working on it, and it runs better now than the final version of Reign of Kings.\nIt will get better. At the time of this review, CodeHatch has released two updates. The first fixed many issues with performance and exploits, while the second fixed what came to be known as, “bow-raiding,” which was almost game breaking. The lesson? They listened. They fixed it. In my opinion, they don’t need an extensive public-relations policy to make these changes and announce it over all social media pages. The game is in early access; there will be roll-backs and there will be wipes.\nThis is why I suggest waiting for a couple of months or the full release before playing. That is, unless, you:\nOverall, I think CodeHatch did an excellent job on Heat. While the abandoning of Reign of Kings is not something to glance over, they’re still a small studio who are self-directed.

I picked it up, streamed it on my channels for both Twitch and Beam and 5 hours later, I don't want to even quit and continue going it's so fun.  I love these types of games.\nAs an early access game is it VERY WELL put together with a lot of rich features for building, crafting, planting, hunting, fishing, and more.  The land is well put together with decent textures, lighting, ambiance, sound and more.  There is no tearing or issues with land masses like some early access games have with falling through floors or animals running through rocks without collision.  The amount of materials gathered is decent as well for each item durability.  The pace of the gathering is decent and it’s not a hard grind or overly unfriendly to game play.  It’s just right.  Also the animals in this game are diverse and thus far I ran across a Hippo, Rhino, Lion, Gazelle, and Zebra.  Most are cautious can hear you approaching like in any hunting wild-life game however, some as you would expect are dangerous and if they see you, decent line of sight/aggro, they will rush you!\nThe building is pretty impressive and fast working from the B letter and then off of your mouse buttons or numeric keypad which you get use to fast.  This is proximity as well so you can lock down certain areas where people can’t build next to you on onto your base.  There are concepts of ‘Clans’ as well to promote people in a guild-type fashion and give them pretty granular permission to either unlock doors, build, destroy, use of chests/crates.  There are also upgrade features to improve your structures from wood, stone, bronze, etc as you gather them across the lands.\nThe environments are very impressive.  So far I ran across nice breezes from the ocean, which by the way you can leverage fishing traps from, winds, rain, impressive lighting storms which flash your screen.  The sounds is spot on.\nIf I were to say anything negative, it would be maybe when you move your mouse off of the active game window you are playing it minimizes the screen to your task bar?  That is probably a feature incoming or maybe because I’m playing windowed mode?  Also, as far as I can tell there is no music which is fine by me because in survival games I never play it just keep the other sounds up to hear things approaching.\nTo me, this is an 8/10 game hands down and I look forward to continued improvements.\n50% off right now this is a STEAL!\nThanks and if you have any questions find me on Twitter @ WowProfitz.", "hours": 14.4, "username": "Profitz", "products": 184, "found_helpful": 19, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": true}

It has many good feautures, the battles are based on skill and agility and the main game is fresh. I enjoyed every game, even though in the beginning I was barely making any kills but slowly I started to catch the game's mechanics and got myself a nice victory.\nShould you buy the game?\nWell, its mostly up to you, if you would like to play this game before its release in late 2018 or early 2019, then go ahead, you also get a few bonuses and there is no point telling you about the reasons as I just stated them above in my opinion of the game.\nWhat are the downsides?\nThe game is clearly not complete and misses many things that could make it better, the games might get boring after you play for around 10/20 hours in the same map, but if you are like me and dont mind you should be fine. Another downside is the lack of movement when you fight, in the Dying Light main game we can do awesome moves to the Night Hunters killing them but in BB the dropkick and other tricks are completely useless against players. This might be changed though so I am not going to see it as a major issue.\nBefore buying:\nIf you are seeing this review, give more thinking before buying, I have seen some people complain about the game because they just bought it without seeing what its acutally about, so my best tip would be to think about the game genre, if you would like it or not and see youtube videos on how it works so you can give yourself an idea on the game,\nFinally, thank you Techland for making a really cool Battle Royale game, I hope that more updates will come through and that the game will become even more fun...", "hours": 37.8, "user_id": "76561198119104850", "username": "✪ Samanturi", "products": 36, "found_helpful": 2, "early_access": true}

Level design follows cues from Quake 1, with plenty of fancy walkways and arches, large cathedrals, and the various catacombs of said cathedrals.\nAs for combat, AMID EVIL actually draws some inspiration from the title Painkiller. As you kill enemies, you'll absorb their souls. After enough souls are consumed, the next time you attack, you'll engage in a \"SOUL POWER\" mode. This lasts for a decent amount of time, and each weapon acts differently during it. The default Staff that usually shoots a few bolts of energy here and there suddenly becomes more menacing than the Plasma Gun from DOOM. The Trident makes dudes explode in about a second of sustained fire. The planet launcher (it's hard to explain) now launches suns.\nThe game promises 7 episodes, and the one I've completed contained 5 maps, with the fifth being a boss fight. That's a pretty good amount of content, and you're also getting a pretty fun survival mode as well.

It's an amazing game in every way except for one.. The graphics. I am not nostalgic for Quake like graphics, and I only wished it had modern graphics.\nLooks like New Blood Interactive heard my (and many others') cry.. They made Amid Evil. And it looks amazing. Not exactly in its graphics per se, but the environments look epic and the lighting is top notch. Some areas that I came across made me go wow. What's more? It plays even better than it looks.\nThe movement is awesome as well. It feels like it has weight, while at the same time you're moving at high speed. The weapons feel meaty as well and satisfying to fire (or cast).\nAmid Evil has the 'collecting souls' mechanic, like you did in Painkiller. Once you fill up the meter, you turn invincible (technically) for a small period of time. You do take damage during the time, but your weapons get a huge buff, so you could quickly delete any enemies in front of you.\nThe levels are huge and superbly lit, and have that 'hardcore game' feel.  You're never sure  what could be next, as you feel like you're falling deeper and deeper into a pit  (sometimes you do so literally).\nOverall it is shaping up to be one of the best games I've ever played already. It feels great, looks great artistically, and sounds great too. Mustn't forget to give props to Andrew Hulshult for the music. If you like Dusk, you're going to want to play this.

Feel free to look through the patch notes, and notice how every patch seems to add some kind of cosmetic item while being very, very sparse on actual balance changes and lacking new content altogether. Last balance patch, (that also added cosmetics, of course,) was October 29th. 15 days ago. Last new content: October 4th. What was it? A single new type of zombie boss, of which there are now 3 types total. That has been the one and only content update since launch two months ago.\n-Still no duo queue.\n-Guns still insta-win in 1v1.\n-Shield nerf was poorly thought out. The problem wasn't that you could pull it out super quick it (which was the only meaningful counter to a surprise shotgun pull-out at close range,) it was that you could put it AWAY super quick and immediately parry your opponent while they were mid charge up swing. They only needed to nerf that part but instead they nerfed they draw time as well which served as a huge indirect buff to guns.\n-Stun recovery time variance still extremely unclear (Why can I sometimes get a heavy attack off on someone after I parry them and othertimes not even when they aren't using DIY shield? Why can I sometimes hit them three times and other times only twice before they can parry again? Lag? By design? If by design what's the variable factor? Nobody seems to know for sure.)\n-Player base is so small that people are all but guaranteed to find their friends if they queue at the same time and then they just team up on everyone, and if they banned the people doing this there would be nobody left to play against.\n-Still need increased incentive to fight the \"hard\" zombie bosses due to huge risk of vulturing. (I still suggest making chance of finding legendary weapon randomly while looting very small and giving high chance of drop when killing a demolisher/super-goon.)\n-Change weapon stacking. Why can I carry 5 mines and 10 axes but only 1 frag/molotov? Completely arbitrary.\n-Why can you still full sprint while out of stamina?\n-Why in god's name does throwing a bludgeon stagger the opponent as well as do damage? Bladed weapons inflict a bleed while bludgeons do a full on stagger.\nThe list goes on... I have very little hope any of these things will be addressed. It's very clear from the amateurish patch note formatting at the beginning (literally \"The Kukri is now balanced\" and no other info,) to the massive delay between patches, (10+ days or more between tiny, tiny balance adjustments that involve a little bit of number tuning and no actual reworking) to the fact that most of the patches have very few changes, that this game is at the back of the backburner.

But I just wonder why they went with $20 and not $10 or something.\nAmazing parkour is back, Dying Light can do no wrong there. But I never really thought about how the combat would work in PVP until I sat down and played a few games. When you're in Dying Light wrecking zombies the 'combat' feels great (unless you're fighting the human NPCs (~foreshadowing~)). But as the top red review says much better than I do, the combat against humans is just lacking some kind of pizzazz, whatever that means.\nSome things I think the game needs to improve accessibility:\n--Kick seems to be permamently on the A button which is unusual feeling, parry is where my kick was on RB (I use southpaw). An option to alter this would be nice, I don't think there is an option to change kick off A for gamepad.\n--When you're scrolling through items and weapons on Dpad and are only two slotted, you should go from 1empty fist slot back to the first weapon or item, not through 2 fist slots.\n--CANCEL ANIMATION BUTTON FOR SEARCHABLES. Say you open the drop crate in a contested area, you can't cancel the animation. If this is an intentional design decision of risk vs reward then so be it, but I personally feel like there should at least be a delayed cancel button or something (if you press the open button you better be committed because you can't stop it). Maybe you have to tap the B button fast to cancel the animation or something, as a suggestion.\nTechland seems like a reputable company, I trust them to do right by their product one way or another.\nEDIT: this game barely has 30 people playing it at peak times now. f2p might not save this.", "hours": 4.7, "username": "abs", "products": 275, "early_access": true}

There is a lot of chopping, mining, & resources are expensive to craft with. It's a little slow going at first, & if you dont protect yourself, just like in RL, you can be robbed and loose everything. Make friends, or at least allies. Find an active server-they can be sorted to find the type of experience you are looking for.\nPersonally I love the designing aspect of the game, and with as much resource gathering that each item takes, it leaves you with a sense of \"hot damn I'm awesome\" when you have upgraded your little shack to a house with planter boxes. Or a castle with mazes and poisioned arrow traps if thats more your thing. There's gliders and steamboats to work towards. And then there's hunting. Yeah, I totally suck at hunting, But fighing with a pirate sword is a totally different story.

Personally, I prefer both\nand\nover this title for the following reasons:\n1) I find\nto be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that.\n3) The level design in\nis much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original\n. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of\n, or the dystopian cityscape of\nfar more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed.\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with\n. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\nPlease don't get me wrong.\nis a welcome addition to the genre.

The game itself is an amazing idea, with almost infinite replayability. Especially for the people who love a good roleplaying experience. I joined an official server for my first hour or two in game and everyone was having fun roleplaying and really enjoying the idea of staking out land in the west or improving the east. After spending that time on the officials, I decided to invest some time looking for a roleplay server in order to make the game more interesting and more realistic. I immediately found about 10-15 roleplay servers all averaging about 20 players each. I decided to play an Irish settler and moved out west near tombstone, became friends with the local sheriff and was deputized in about 2 hours. We rode around the vast frontier on horses trying to prevent Native raids from happening and protected the town of tombstone together. All you need for a game like this to be great is a good community.\nNow, for the all coveted frame rates for my build.\nOn my build, with the highest possible settings, I average 30-40 frames but if i drop down to just the high settings, i play at a steady 60 frames. Which for me is a completely playable range. Anyone who leaves comments about not being able to run it with above 20 frames probably doesn't meet something on the recommended specs. Overall, it needs work, don't get me wrong, but it's very playable in the current state.\nI know Codehatch has a history but I have plenty of friends and myself who got our moneys worth out of Reign of Kings and some of my friends got plenty of fun out of StarForge. I am willing to give them this chance because this game is truly going to open up some great moments in game. It is definitely a risk that they will stop developing after awhile but I am gonna enjoy it either way. Overall, it's worth the $20 and is a ton of fun, so I would totally invest in it and have some fun.\n(If something changes within the game itself and it becomes unplayable or if support stops for the game, my original review is subject to change.)", "hours": 24.1, "user_id": "76561198114775164", "username": "Bardagamaður dauðans", "products": 111, "found_helpful": 30, "found_funny": 2, "early_access": true}

You however can craft rafts to travel the seas to hop on another island or explore an abandoned ship(?), craft ballista a big harpoon you have to manned to defend your base, craft a siege or catapult to break down walls of your enemies, or craft a glider for you to soar the sky and throw stones to their roof which are easy to craft.\n*Building bases is like RUST, it has square/triangle foundation and whatnots. But it needs more improvements. You can't easily lay it down and you can't freely choose how the square/triangle foundation faces.\n*Lastly I hate the cave I went into to mine ore twice. The cave is narrow, very deep and total darkness. You need a torch on your left hand and a pickaxe on your right. Your vision is limited because of the dark, the ores you have to mine are too realistic that they blend perfectly to the environment. While you have an ability like sonar to detect items you can interact on a 4square foundation radius with 2s(?) cooldown. It still gave me a hard migraine (I don't know if it's just me since I generally get headaches when playing first person and you move too much on super dark environments. but this game was the worst migraine I've got).\nThis is my comparison review with only 6hrs of gameplay.

For example - certain enemies are really nasty if they get up close, and knowing that there's a place you can skitter back to and strafe them will make the difference between taking a hit or not.\nThe level design is amazing. The starting zone has portals for easy, medium, and hard difficulty - which are respectively easy, medium, and hard to get to. There's a harder than hard evil difficulty that you have to find if hard isn't hard enough. It only gets better from there. The ambient sights and sounds are fun to look over (I spent a bit on the first level standing at a high point that looked over where I started the level), and puzzles that require some spatial memory and reasoning to figure out. And there's just enough ammo to do self-imposed challenges like one-weapon only runs or no-health runs if you're really looking for a challenge. And hunting secret areas is another thing you can do - there's a nice counter in the tab menu, one that's usually telling me I'm missing one or two secret areas despite hunting for the better part of an hour.\nIt kind of handles like a faster Deathmatch Classic from pre-Steam days. Unrealistic fantasy weapons like a sword that shoots ranged slices through the air, or a literal planet-launcher that you can rocketjump (planetjump?) with. An axe that essentially turns into a blender if you use it during soul mode aka \"all your weapons are supercharged\" mode. The axe is the only non-ranged weapon, and if you want to use it you're gonna need some pretty good reflexes.\nThere are a few shortcomings - I've only made it through the first half dozen levels, but the AI seems easy to game. Certain places will get enemies stuck, or they'll flip out and be easy pickings. Some parts of the terrain are glitchy - which sucks if you're running backwards and get your foot stuck on what seems like an invisible hole. And maybe it's a personal preference but some weapons just aren't practical given that they share ammo with another weapon (though they are fun).\nBut seriously, in all this is a great game if you like running around blasting things that rush up trying to cut off your face, with some puzzles and platforming mixed in. Using a whisper's edge to counter a sword blast from a baddie is very satisfying - and using soul mode to power up your weapons and blast everything is fun - lots of power, but you still take damage and can die if you forget your mortality.\nHighly recommended.

FPS lovers in general will enjoy this for sure, as it brings up the best in the genre while working in that original Quake-age taste. Be warned, though: graphics are not realistic, game-like choices will surely appear down your way and skills needed to go through are quite different than those required for modern FPS (No cover, no reloads, just plain old run, shoot and strafe... And mind your step, lest you fall to your death!). It floats my boat. How about you?\nThat being said, let's give out some details.\nLike many players around here, I'm a huge fan of Heretic/Hexen series. For me, it was the best fantasy FPS experience to date, by far. It goes without saying, then, that I've been eager to see more of this game right here (this being the main reason for the sudden purchase at early access).\nAnd I gotta tell you, I've got that nostalgic feeling by playing my very first minutes of this one. It's been a while since I last took on a FPS, and I'm quite rusty, but still, this immediately reminded me of the good old days of demon slaying back at the cursed docks of Heretic.\nControls are very fluid and mechanics are spot-on to me. Character movement flows well within the map, with responsive inputs and a satisfying shooting experience. Weapons are a pleasure to use so far, and the map is well-structured, ready to host secrets of all sorts, rewarding exploration and allowing for a lot of loops as you hunt for keys and slay sentinels of at least four distinct kinds.\nThe graphics are perfect for the approach the devs have in mind, taking me all the way back to the good old Quake days. There's a filter applied over it (or at least that was my impression) that made the image a bit granulous, giving it an interesting 'vintage' aspect. Another thing that I have to mention is the font of choice for the menus, screaming 'Iron Maiden' as soon as I booted the game! That's very refined and adds yet another nostalgic tone to the experience.\nMusic is very good, arranged to match the environment. At some point it made me feel as if trudging around the water levels from Heretic once more, with a primal, yet subtle, tune in the back to match the pace.\n|'ll be playing more of this as time allows and I'll be sure to update this thread, as well as the video feed back at the channel!\nTHREE-HOUR UPDATE: So far I've crossed a few maps and went through a boss battle. The game seems well-balanced, with maps that unfold in an elegant way. A true stimulus to exploration and memorable encounters, as the topography contributes to strategy-building and secret-finding. Dialogue between dev and player through hints is well defined, granting a number of ways to work the maps around.\nThe only issue I found is a recurring stuck enemy by the third level IIRC. Something minor and honestly to be expected at EA.\nSTILL Totally worth it!\n9/10", "hours": 3.6, "username": "Archon Basileus", "products": 681, "early_access": true}

Whilst there is no players in the server it plays like a relaxing rust with a lot more to learn and craft.\nThe game runs very nice indeed and you dont need super specs to make this game playable!\nI really hope this game starts to get more coverage as i think populated servers will make this game incredibly fun!\nThere is a few small parts that need attention, but nothing game breaking in the slightest!\nDevs - The bow needs some TLC, although i have now got to grips with it, i feel it needs more of a quick, it needs to feel like it has a bit of power behind it.\nTrees - although noticable i think you should make larger trees longer to harvest but giving you more wood, smaller ones less wood and quicker harvest.\nI would like to see tools like the axe and pick axe be able to place on the quick bars. so you can have tools on number slots 1 and 2 and then carry a melee wepaon and a bow equipt as well.\nThe torch looks great - just could do with a slight nerf on the brightness, i some times need to almost be touching a tree with the torch out to see it at night.\nCaves - look epic, would be awesome to create epic cave bases. being able to block the front entrance off with walls and doors, and being able to place torches on the walls would be amazing!\nI would consider myself a survival game expert haha!

It's incredaibly realistic in 99.5% of all aspects of gaming elements, from night to day, to walking in caves and in the wild.  My only downside of the game I would point out is that it can be a little too dark and requires manual adjustments of either monitor and/or gaming profiles of your video cards manager. One other thing I would like to point out that is a downer for me, is the amount of wood u have to farm versus the amount u spend while building shelters and what not.  The build prices are too high as well as the pillage factors when destroying builds, is too low.  The game forces more time to players to farm wood than it actually does to play the game and have fun.\nHowever, having said that, I would recommend this game to ANYONE and EVERYONE as it has not stopped me from playing and enjoying the game.  Positives of the game aside from the aforementioned is everything else in the game.  The environment from the sun rise to the sun set, the thunder storms which are so realistic, the walking ine the grasslands and having a tiger lundge toward you, can literally scare the crap out of u, especially if your eyes are focused on something else when it occurs.  The building of shelters and what not is awesome in itself.\nA few suggestions for adding/changing to next release, would be to decrease build costs, increase pillage refunds, decrease the amount of time it takes to farm wood (faster chipping, etc...), make siege builds and weapons harder to obtain and/or build.  Those costs are way too low and need to allow players to establish themselves before getting seiged, etc...\nAgain, this game is probably one of the most realistic and through games, fully polished, that you will play.  If you player ark, then u will love this game.  Ark is too involved and takes toooooo long to do anything. OOR allows and helps u through ur quests, etc...

{"product_id": "656240", "page": 52, "page_order": 2, "recommended": true, "date": "2019-02-01", "text": "First of I would like to give an honest review to this game. I watched the trailer and was immediately interested in this game.\nI own Reign of Kings and actually bought a few copies for my friends as well and had a lot of fun on that game. Sure it wasn't perfect but it was certainly fun.\nI have noticed a lot of reviews about this game are written by salty people who are actually lying in their review...you are meant to review the game in its own right...not drag it down because of another title that didn't live up to your standards.\nPlaying this game I was amazed at the detail and the size of the map. It's very lush and looks really great. I noticed no performance issues with it and all of the crafting is logical. You can level up and pick new research. You build anywhere on the map and make your own little village. There is wild life from what I have seen and even tameable horses! A train runs around the map as well. Not sure what it does but maybe you could Rob it?\nI have a 1080GTX, 32gb DDR4 RAM, I7-7700k and have this on an SSD. Game runs really well which is surprising for the amount of detailing in the terrain and objects.\nWhen you first start this game you can make your character it's a simple builder but still allows for some unique designs. You also design your flag/coat of arms here too.\nI will write a more detailed review soon but for now this will have to do.\nWhy should you buy this?\nIt's the America and set in what appears to be the mid 1800s. You can make a family, be anything you want. Get friends on and make a fully living town with trade and culture...expand to making a city that will dwarf anyone around you.\nRoleplay to your heart's content. This game has a very unique feel to it and I believe it will be an awesome platform for many role-players who like this particular themed game.\n***Update after 21 hours***\n#I will update this review again once I reach even more time in it.\nFor now everything has been going really smoothly. The few bugs I have encountered are not game breaking, and I also accept them easier as I know this is an ALPHA game and I agreed to the challenge of bugs from the moment I bought it.#\nI now have a house that is two stories and I'm approaching the bronze age with my technology. I have a nice farm going and live beside a big river with views of the great snowy mountain range. I'm pregnant in game to my friend irl who decided we needed to expand our population to combat the wild animals that come down from the range above us.\nWe're deciding on how to get more ore, as we need a lot of iron and copper to build new things and unlock new technology. We will probably move south into Indian country to feast on the rich minerals down there.\n\nPostivie: Graphics on this game are good. The game is lush, highly detailed, and very diverse. I have not really seen repetitive textures or landmarks as of yet. Each part of the map feels different and has different wild life and plants. Game runs well on around 50-60fps on my rig.\nNegative: Some textures load in a little slowly and can be blurred at close distance.\n4/5 at this point.\n\nPostive: I would say this game is great for the money I paid for it. So far the leveling, crafting, and options are vast and interesting. You will be kept busy for at least 15 hours alone to get a good sized house and the basic crafting devices. There is hundreds of recipes, loads of different ranged and melee weapons, lots of different crafting recipes for furniture, stations, tools, devices. Adding people to parties are fairly easy but you must be able to select them face to face.\nNegative: The game is lacking any real AI challenge from what I have discovered though.\nI have had a few run ins with wild animals and they are a hard challenge (maybe a little much?). A few examples is when I shot a wild wolf in a field. Killed it after around 20 shots with an arrow to the head. As I was attempting to skin it I was bum rushed by 3 bulls and a bison. Apparently they all went agro on me because of the wolf? Spawning near your death to an animal will cause it to run up to you on spawn and attempt to kill you again.\nAI humanoids are lacking. Correct me if I am wrong but I have never seen a bandit even though I know they are in the code. Humanoids such as native Americans and civilians are roaming randomly around and you cannot interact with them. I am not sure if I am missing something, do you need to use a gift on them?\n3/5 on content at the moment (this will change if more promised content is released).\nNegative: The GUI is very basic and looks similar to RoK. It is not that pleasing to the eye but does display what you need (on the main menu).\nFinding what you want in your inventory or in your crafting menu is frustrating. I am not sure on how to search for a particular item...this is time consuming and annoying at least. Also splitting items by holding right mouse and dragging is not the most innovative.\nPositive: In game with the tech tree I love how they designed it with the different categories being stores and different businesses. I got a big Disney vibe! The whole scroll wheel option for building and interacting with other npcs and tools is a great idea and I like it.\n2/5 for GUI in it's current state.\nPositive: This game runs well, performs well and is reasonably quick. I have noticed no ground breaking issues.\nNegative: This game does not seem to load the first time I click play on Steam. It launches and then closes and usually launches the second time. Saving in this is a little annoying as it pauses the game.\n3/5 for this.\nPositive: The devs are doing a good job at the moment, and are addressing issues when they arrive.\nNegative maybe: Please keep this game going. I know there is a lot of hate from people but I bit the bullet and decided to trust that this game would pull through and prove the haters wrong. I really love this game and the direction it is going. Please keep it going. Keep the HEAT on.\n4/5 for this.\nTotal Score: 16/25 (55-60% positive experience overall).\nI still recommend this and reserve the right to update this as this game is being reviewed as an ALPHA. I in no way feel this game is a waste, I love it!", "hours": 53.0, "username": "hellsvien", "products": 136, "found_helpful": 58, "found_funny": 8, "early_access": true}

The game looks promising with it's vintage visuals and design and loads of weaponry to keep you satisfied.\nBasically the game takes inspiration from 3 Classic Shooters. Heretic (Weaponry) Quake (Level Design) and the original Unreal (Challenge and AI) now I love both of these fantastic games but together I felt the whole thing was completely unbalanced from the start. I don't know what it was, but the combination of the Unreal AI and Heretic made me have to think like this actually was Unreal. I expected the game to be just a modern day Heretic but the whole combination of different games (Hexen included) makes it so jumbled.\nBut am I having fun? Yes. It's definitely not as satisfying as DUSK, but I'm sure this game will have a cult following just like it due to the old school nature of it. Weaponry is cool and sometimes you get to use a special ability to kill everyone! It's really cool. The point is though, I suggest you wait until this is out. New Blood is one of the most promising publishers of the decade and I can't wait to see what they do with this game.\nSorry it was a short review but I'm really tired.", "hours": 3.6, "username": "Siegfried The Scout", "products": 674, "found_helpful": 6, "early_access": true}

It's dark. The instructions say to find food - in the dark. You wander aimlessly, discover you can chop wood like in other crafting games, try to chop rocks but nothing doing. Then you're killed by a hippo; there is now a respawn counter - so you have to sit there and ... what? think about what you've done? Anyway, now you have to start back on the beach, and wait\nto get back to wandering aimlessly.\nBut this time, you strike at a rock and whoa, it says you have gathered stones. I see: some stones are stonable, others are just decoration. How can you tell? You strike at them and pray. Still no sign of this mythical food you're supposed to be gathering, but that plant is lit different from the background (a time-honored tradition in games that indicates said object is not \"background\" but rather something you can interact with). Oh, too bad for you: it's just a plant that's lit different from all the rest. Nothing to see here, move along.\nFound a corn plant! Press action to gather corn. Watch the \"gather corn\" spinner 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... I'm going to die of boredom before I die of hunger. Oh, wait, it didn't take all of the corn plant. Press action again: 1 ... 2, press action again in hopes of getting a move on: game scolds you saying you can't do multiple things at once. Wait for the spinner to reach the 11 o'clock position, press action, enter next cycle. You may think: hold down action! You can think that, but thinking is all that will happen.\nThe \"journal\" is now happy you have found corn, and your next task is to make an axe, which requires wood (ok), stones (ok) and a rope?! Welcome to the bane of your existence in this game: searching for flax. They are blue flowered plants that look like some of the other plants (q.v. different from the grass) except you can't see them until you are right up on them. What a fun way to explore this game, trying to identify from a distance whether a differently lit object is something you can interact with, on your way to trying to gather enough flax to make yourself an axe.\nOh, and when you chop trees, they break in half, but the chop tree sound continues as you chop at the stump, but no more wood will emit from the\n.\nSo you wander aimlessly, hoping for good fortune to smile upon you and produce flax plants.\nOh, look, a sunken ship off shore! I bet that has supplies, and maybe even the ever elusive rope. So you walk out into the water, and instantly realize there is something wrong because your stamina meter is dropping even when you're standing still in the water. That's\nno good. Exit the water to recharge your stamina, and re-enter the water without any standing around about it: we're swimming.\nYou have made it almost to the boat, stamina running perilously low (knowing this game will drown your sorry♥♥♥♥♥because it hates you), and you may think about crawling on the rocks in the water, but experience has taught you that there will be no concessions in your favor, best to just try to make it to the ship. Stamina runs out, you begin to sink. But the space bar will raise you back up to the surface, whew. Only, holy cow! Are we being attacked by sharks? No, you just happen to be in the water, with your head above water taking damage from the ... body being in the water? Who knows.\nBut ah ha, you had enough health to survive the attack of the salt water (roll to save versus saline!) and you make it up onto the rocks via the mast that had fallen in the water.

All around, it will only get better IF Code}{atch doesn't ditch it and work on optimizing.\nALSO I found that COde}{atch got a totally new development team, meaning a chance to actually nurture this game.\nI LOVE the game right now, and honestly, content wise it is VERY full. Optimization is probably the biggest weak spot, however, its bearable for a PRE-ALPHA GAME.\nTo be Conclusive; There will be a lot of negative reviews for this game, but to really see the whole picture, you need to know that:\n-The developers COULD be better (no promises tho)\n-It's in EXTREMELY early access, so there will be problems\n-A lot of the reviews here are just bias.\n-They released an update the day after the game was released, fixing some of the community bugs that were reported.\n-The game is really funny tbh\nHonestly, its worth a try. However, its your money to spend. :P", "hours": 36.3, "username": "ElDerpo", "products": 57, "found_helpful": 2, "early_access": true}

They don't explain how you get these certain resources, you will have no idea how to level up and no idea how to do the most basic tasks. It took me two days to figure out how to build, it wasn't until I killed a player inside his built home that I found a \"Building Planner\". EVen after that, building was still confusing. As a new player, you will spend most of your time on the death screen, as any player who has a gun will be smashing you.\nThe game is super grindy and broken. You will play for 2 hours and not even have a base. You proabably won't even be level 2. Doesn't help that the resource gathering is a flip of a coin. So there will be a 50/50 chance that you will even recieve the resources you just gathered. It is a boring task, so all you really want to do is get enough for a bow and arrows, go to the white house and kill every npc that shows up until a player with a gun shows up and wipes you out. NPCs are just brain dead, they are useless, all they are good for is shooting at and looting. Only the president has good npcs, even then they have guns but they just kick you so much, you can't move.\nThe game is only a couple days old and the community is already toxic. I was told I couldn't be on a certain server because I was new, kicked for exploring in the white house, abused for not contributing to the Global chat. Interaction is dead. The only good interaction I had was with a player who couldn't kill me because his fps was 10. If you want roleplay, you need to go somewhere else.\nThe game sets out to be a western roleplaying, survival game. What it achieves is being a frustrating mess where bears will chase you accross the entire map. Nothing works for it to be immersive or even give off a little emotion. I don't care about my character, my gear OR my base.

The first is where all the peaceful people live in harmony and engage in friendly PVP with justified reason to go around killing others and taking their stuff afterwards. The other is where all the loud mouthed griefers live, where just about everyone goes around killing and raiding anyone they find, even if the victims clearly do not have anything valuable on them. Before the merge, I was in Oceanic C1, which was where everyone from the former camp segregated themselves from the griefers in A1. It was a lot of fun with an incredible amount of roleplay and justified player killings. Now, the players who used to play there have no choice but to play in a hostile environment where it is almost impossible to get off the ground, considering how long it takes to build anything worth calling defences in the game. Even if they are successful in doing so, tearing it all down takes less than 10 minutes. Any complaints are met with heckling, shaming or continued griefing. I can say from experience that this sort of behaviour and alienation only serves to drive new players away, leaving the servers filled up with either a small population of elites or exclusive clan clubs where starting out solo is almost impossible unless you are as ruthless as the others. In other words, the community is slowly becoming just like those found in many other survival games of today.\nI am not sure if the ideas of the latter camp was the intended way the game was to be played. I have never played Realm of Kings so I cannot relate to how it was before, but I have played plenty of similar games before this one. I will say now to anyone who do not like the communities they have encountered in Rust and various other survival games: either do not bother wasting your money on this, or play with friends on your own server.

It seems they have stepped up their game from their last release as their graphics improved, player models and content (which may not be saying much to some, also some may disagree). Just hoping they stick to it. I believe they must optimize the game for better gameplay performance before they do anything else. Then the server performance, then possibly raise amount of players per lobby, also optimize loading times for sure. With just those couple changes the game would be pretty great.

Especially if you play with others. Holy crap. We hop servers just to start over sometimes lol.\nThe graphics look great and the second to highest setting on my laptop of all things. Well done.\nI love being able to mark things on the map.\nLove the boats, hard to get use to solo but still super cool.\nLove the crafting and building system. It's wonderful to see how much you need of what to make something.\nOnly two suggestions I have for the moment.\nFor the maps - Hopefully you'll be able to see your buildings or more so, clan structures on the map. That would be a HUGE plus.\nFor lighting. Something permanent for the base. Not something you constantly add fat to, but something perm to help you find your way in the dark.\nOther than that.

At first i expected reign of kings with guns, and that kinda what it was but there was more too it, levels, learning blueprints, a in game market to buy and sell goods, mounts, animal taming etc. After my playtime i can say that the gun play is odd but fun people (including yourself) don't feel like bullet sponges even at max health. Animals can be challenging at time but can be cheesed by running into water. Ore nodes seem to be rare making metal a pain to go and get but makes it have value. Crafting times can be long.. very long (ex: 1hr 30min for a gun to craft). the game looks great i run it on medium with a 1080ti, at first i had to make sure i didn't have anything els open because it was a demanding game but as of now it runst more smoothly and im getting around the mid 70's for fps. Some of the odd things i found is issues with animal bodies, you kinda have to hit the right spot in order to harvest and knifes need a buff because after 4 or so animals you need to repair or grab another one. Weight is odd because it can be worked around via piggy back or a mount (mounts are not worth it due to the fact the eat more than you can pump into them). You also have pipes that cost 1 wood and sell for a good bit making it the only way to stockpile money. The sales tax is a bit too high for me at 50%. Building vs raiding needs to be evened out more i know its a hard spot to find but right now its not realy worth it when i can just shoot peoples doors and get in most bases in under a min. When it comes to the 4 different positions i know what you get with everything except chief, and boy do they need a hefty nerf, the president gets a cannon tho it doesn't damage walls at the moment it does destroy stockpiles and other placeables making raiding way to op because all someone has to do it sit on a chair and get a good bit of guns and with abusing weight with a friend means raiding is way too easy. In the end i do enjoy this game i hope they add more too it and fix some issues. It could be a good game but that's up to the devs. Now is it worth a buy? Well i like it and enjoy it but i know its not for everyone i would say wait and watch videos and just get informed before you buy it and if you are paying i say look at it in its current state and say would i buy this right now.

The developers have risen to the challenge of optimizing the game at a healthy pace and the balance/tweeks have been rolling out. If this continues, I expect a well rounded and polished title.\nAt the moment there's still issues with the game, such as rubber banding, general server instability, and abusable game mechanics. No fall damage enables a lot of these general shananigans! As you can just build a ladder just outside of an enemies territory, so, there's nothing to stop you from stacking these ladders on top of each other until you reach the heavens. Then you can simply leap to the roof of any base. The in game solution to this seems to be \"buying more land\" around your main base but \"buying land\" isn't made very clear at all. I didn't figure that out for a long time. Knowing is half the battle after all.\nThe leveling up system is a bit slow and max level is a bit high. I don't see a need for 60 levels of experience. That's a huge cap, especially when most new players will play for the first time, create a base, log out and then get raided simply to never play the game again. As of now it takes FOREVER to level up, even with the updates so far, and even longer to be able to safeguard a base. I'd go so far as to say this game is simply not possible as a solo player against the world. The upkeep is too great and the big guilds are too many. It's either join a guild or rally your own friends together to create your own. I'd eventually like to see it only take about 20-30 hours of casual play to achieve max level.\nThumbs up.

You can hunt various wild animals for food, and cook and eat thier meat to survive, so... yeah... survival. The servers aren't completely empty though, and the community seems cool, so no complaints there.\nThe graphics are sub-par and the animations are shoddy (most if not all the animals' walking animations skip before repeating).

However, It is an early access game for only $15 and I have checked in multiple times and seen some minor gameplay improvement and new content.\nIs it worth it?

I have almost 700 hours in game and have played the game for about 9 months. It is pirate themed game where you have been shipwrecked on tropical islands. Just like most survival games you have to gather food and resources to keep you alive and build up a base. Depending on the type of server you play your experiance will change.\nPvE:\n~ No PvP\n~ Harder to find areas to build as there is no raiding\n~ Good way to learn the game before starting PvP\n~ Some players like to roleplay and trade\n~ Players are more friendly\nStandard:\n~ PvP enabled\n~ Raiding enabled\n~ Hardest gather speed\n~ Resources are more valuable\n~ Base protection (depending on the resources invested) between 3 hours - 3 days\n~ Slower paced in terms of development\n~ More spaces to build\n- Players will either attack you or help you\n(My opinion the best type of server to play as I find it the most fun)\nPvP:\n~ PvP enabled\n~ Raiding enabled\n~ Easiest gather speed (up to x5)\n~ Resources are less valuable\n~ Base protection (depending on the resources invested) between 1 minute - 15 minutes\n~ Faster paced\n~ Usually very built up\n~ You're most likely going to die alot if you havn't played the game before\nThis game is very unique to other games such as Rust and Ark. Yes it isn't as developed as these games or as popular but personally I have played Rust and would recommend this game over it. Rust doesn't give me the rush I have when playing this game. PvP in this game is a little glitchy and can have some improvements in terms of smoothness however it gets me really hyped and me and my group really enjoy PvP in this game. Whereas compared to Rust you could walk around and get one shotted from 100m away and not know where he was or have any way to fight back. However in this game you have to choose carefully what armour you choose and sometimes combine the different tiers of armour to fit your purpose. In this game you can be a slow tank walking around in metal armour or a fast archer running in leather armour.\nResource gathering is very painful, just like any survival game, the grind is hard but it adds more value to it. This game requires lots of hard decision making on 'Shall I bring this armour out?' 'Do I want to carry this must resources with me at once or shall I take multiple trips?' However with the animations when farming it can be very fun. Such as falling trees when they run out of use instead of vanishing like Rust. Or possibly the breaking  up of stones when rocks are no longer filled with stones to give you.\nCrafting in this game is very unique. You require different tools and crafting areas to make tools. But what makes this game even more interesting is the fact you have to load an anvil with a casted part from your furnace and physically hit it with a hammer until it is shaped. Something I havn't seen any other game do.\nAnd my favourite part, raiding. I have never felt so satisfied raiding in any survival game other than this game. There is a range of ways to infiltrate a base: trebuchet, glider, seige projectiles. Sometimes you have to use all of them to bring down a base. They all have their strengths and weaknesses and makes the game great!\nOne of the cons of the game is map size. The map can't really fit 30 or more players in it. There aren't many spawn points so you find new spawns running into eachother, one getting killed and then refunding the game. Although there are plans for new islands and improving spawn locations.\nThis game is heavily worked on and the devs are very open to the community on suggestions and advise. I have seen features I have requested implemented in this game and bugs I have reported fixed within a patch.\nLastly there is only one issue I have with this game, population, many people buy the game on sale and refund it without giving it a chance. Most just say 'rust is better' and leave within 5 minutes of joining. Or people get so mad that they lose a base and quit the game completely. I have seen this alot and it is sad to see as this is such a good game. Most just need to get over it and start again and improve what got them killed last time. That is the best attitude to have.\nHonestly you should stop reading reviews and give the game a go, you will not be disappointed.\nIf you have any questions about the game add me on steam or would like some help starting out do the same.", "hours": 873.0, "username": ".X", "products": 174, "found_helpful": 118, "found_funny": 10, "early_access": true}

The gators are easily avoided as are the other animals, but you NEED to kill them to survive. Berries and Corn are availabe as food items...if you can find them so look high and low for both.

Read on, because there are some pros and cons.\nBefore I bought the game I did some research as always. Just so I know what I would buy and if there’s a change that I would like it for more than a few hours of gameplay. By the time I write this review I have played this game for 17 hours and had a lot of fun.\nI do like survival games as well as crafting and (base)building games. It lets me tap into my creativity and it’s more relaxing than other game genres I play. But what makes Out of Reach so interesting from other games? Well, for starters, you play on a server and you can choose the way you want to play (PVE, PVP or STD). I see a couple of people complaining about the fact that you can get raided by other players. That’s true and you will lose your base and or stuff. But that’s the fun! It’s a survival game after all.\nLet’s look into PVP and STD (standard) gameplay. If you are unlucky and log into a server with grievers, the game would suck. Try to find a server where you can join clans and/or make your own. Build your own base or help a clan to build their base. Defend it and work together to maintain your position in the world. Explore together and make damn sure you have the right stuff for battles (like armor and weapons). I never take too much stuff with me. Because if you lose a fight and die, the raiders will take it all (obviously). If you’re lucky your friends will pick up your stuff and take it with them to the base so you can get it back. It’s the excitement of wondering around exploring the map and gather resources for your clan. If you have enough and if you think your clan is strong enough, set out to find other clans and destroy them.\nThe PVP servers are typical for PVP gameplay. It’s against each other and not much else. The environment is hostile as well but that’s just how the game is designed. The pvp extends the standard survival gameplay. It’s much harder to survive while fighting against other people than against the environment.\nStandard mode gives you the best of PVP and PVE. You can do both. I started a server and I’m playing with a friend. We started out by playing together and work out the gameplay. See how the game feels and works. It’s a good way for new players to find a standard server with people who are willing to teach you how the game works (as well for PVE as PVP).\nI think PVE gameplay is easy to understand. You against the environment and not against other players. It’s possible to build different clans but you’re not fighting each other.\nSince it’s an early access game there are some bugs and possible improvements. I did not found any bugs that make the game unplayable. I have an ‘old pc’ and it runs fine. So the higher end pc’s shouldn’t have much issues.\nThe pros of the game are:\nThe cons of the game are:\nIn the end I recommend this game to people who like survival games and do want to support the devs in early access stages.\nWhere the game is heading I don’t know. I do hope that the game will be developed into something fun and with unexpected gameplay twists. It has a lot of potential, like a lot of other early access games, and I hope the devs see that as well and continue to work on this game.", "hours": 19.6, "username": "Lobster", "products": 701, "found_helpful": 13, "early_access": true}

(this is something that isnt a big issue if the would adjust the lighting a little.\nReally thats it for the bad there are a few more things i find irritating but i wont put them down because im sure they will be fixed at a later date.\nI not only recommrnd that you buy this game i would encourage you to because it will be a great game but only if we show faith in it.

The game is a bit laggy, of course depends on your pc, so I am running it now at 30fps, but runs and it's visually stunning and lots of  fun. You can do so many cool things, riding , mating, roping people for instance. Buildings are so pretty, land is awesome, fighting  mechanic is more or less the same as Reign of Kings so it’s amazing, skill tree is super cool, there is leveling up, and so much content. There is money $ in the game, so you build a shipping chest and gather resources sell them in it and make money that you can use to buy better quality stuff, also you can run bears and horses. The game has so many biomes, and I bet when this game is optimized well it could be maybe the best game ever! :)\nIn conclusion so if you don't care of running it at low fps run now it's totally worth the $19!", "hours": 264.9, "username": "Astro", "products": 58, "early_access": true}

After messing around a bit with the settings I got it to where it was playable at around 40-60 fps depending on the location. If you're looking to claim you're first foundation, I recommend not going near the white house area as that lags a lot with major frame drops. Graphics may not look great compared to the trailer, but I think the gameplay is way more important imo.\nI've played with one of my friend and I'd have to say it is addicting as I've played 11 hrs straight on the first day of release. We've managed to build a house in the middle of forest with a beautiful view of the mountains and rivers. There's a lot of things you could do in the game from riding horses, making babies, to kidnapping people and chopping their heads off with an axe. Unlike Atlas, you won't die of hunger/thirst within like 5 seconds of spawning. I have not run for president or do anything political yet but I will update my review when I do.\nI would recommend this game if you have friends to play with it as it could be hard to play solo due to all the resources you would need to build and craft things.

I loved this game it was a wonderful game to work with for such a long time, it did have it flaws and bugs. The game is a wondeful game, SpaceBoatStudios has worked hard to meet players demands. I emailed them a while back, and I remeber them stating they didn't want to have more ranged weapons in the game, then players demanded it, and they worked towards adding cannons and pistols. It has been sad for me to own the game for so long and never see the community grow and thrive. I loved this game for a very long time, the ships excited me, the hunting system was pretty well done. I loved the skill system and well it took a while to reach certain goals each one seemed useful to me. I remeber why I joined the game and stayed there in the first place. I ran into some noob and we started chatting with one another. It was an excellent time, I was like hey I'm gonan go huntin and he joined me. Little did we know rhinos will keep the everloving **** out of you. So we respawned, gave up on our stuff and decided hey why not raid a base? That was another poor decision... we got heckin rekt and a half. We spent a while working with one another and building our clearly perfect in every way home. It was an excellent time for me, I loved working with other people. I invited my freind (and payed for the cheap bastard (JK ur lit un-named freind)) and we played together and played some more, until we finnaly got the best everything. We made our house on rhino island, and used the little steam raft things to get from place to place. Then we stopped playing. Then we came back and player some more did the exact same thing on a diffrent server and stopped playing. I came back to this game a few weeks later and found some pretty cool updates exactely what my freind and I had been asking for, new boats, pirates, stuff like that. The sad thing is the game was more dead than ever. We aloung with most of the community got what we wanted, and the game is still dying. My freind and I loved the game for so long, so much to do, so many challanges, so many time we would kill people (mostly one another) and so many bets (that I totalley won 110% (except maybe one or two (ok maybe most of them.)))\nI know look back at this game as something, I really loved at one point in time. The reason I don't like it as much now, is the complete lack of community. I think the real issue here is the players who played wanted new things to make the game feel less boring while the real issue was, the game was lacking a community to still be good. So people left and quit, or demaned they add so and so until they finnaly left as well. This game is dying (if not dead.) My hope in making this review postive, is that we as players will still play. The most fun you will have is with your freinds, if you don't play with someone the game is bound to feel lacking, the bigger the group the better, and hopefully you'll find another group just as big to slaughter endless and have fun doing it.\n<3", "hours": 92.0, "username": "Colonel Therin", "products": 49, "found_helpful": 17, "early_access": true}

There is only one way to travel at start, and that is by foot. You can get a horse if you're president (or is that a bear available? idk), or a horse for the governor (which I was briefly, after walking for an hour or so).\nWhy is the server capped at 32 players for a map that takes hours to traverse? Even RoK had 50 player servers (or was that unoffical?), and a map that was probably 75% smaller.\nI killed myself twice in hopes of being able to relocate to a different area, and the spawn was the same all 3 times. No option to spawn anywhere but random (which is only one location).\nOver 2 hours played and only saw one NPC in a town, and didn't run into a single soul in that time. My guess is all 32 people were just fighting over being president. Fix the server pop (should be 100 with the size of the map), and then this game may be worth the $20. I just can't see investing any time in this when I likely won't see anyone, unless we all end up building near the capital. Just the travel time alone between the capital and governor mansion was easily 30+ minutes of walking, with a whole of nothing to do in between but beat things with your sack.\nScale down the map size, or scale up (drastically) the server cap.

That's really all there is left anymore...a few players. Also, bulding has some rough edges, although it's overall a fun building experience. Gathering is a rather tedious part of the game, whether thats hunting, logging, etc.\nHowever, I think the largest problem with OOR is players not wanting to take the leap from Surviving to Seiging. The game could really use more advanced clan support. Such as the ability to communicate more effectively to your clan, or even offline messaging to show your hold is being seiged. Also, some sort of clan scoring system might be nice. Other than the same old loot, what are we fighting for again? There's not much motivation to work together, outside of pairing to survive random pks. If the developers are hoping people form clans that stick around, provide a setting that makes it fun and worthwhile. Give me a reason, as a survivor, to band up with people and fight.\nAside from a few other hostile players, its not hard to survive...at all. The environment poses very little challenge, other than your ability to collect tons of materials to build the simplest things. It's essentially a materials chase, but there is no ticking clock. You wont get cold, and hunger is fairly easy to overcome. Items degrade, and that's about it.\nMelee combat is as basic as it comes, including pvp. Connecting a blow isn't satisfying at all. The only thing that is satisfying about pvp combat is the loss (in materials) your opposition will face. Speed matters sometimes, as armor can slow you down. Ranged combat is somewhat more interesting and fun. Is this skill-based? Not at all, although a good ping will likely help you along the way.\nHFGL", "hours": 75.1, "username": "Spykers", "products": 153, "found_helpful": 18, "early_access": true}

What would really make this game is if it had a better crafting system the one right now works just fine and is functional but gets a little boring after a while and you tend to spend too much time gathering resources for your base. there is a mode that makes it easier and faster to get them but its focus is on killing not so much the building part. also the animals are kinda sad they look good and can do their job well but they lack the animal feel they are to much like a robot to me not because of how they move but were they go when they stop and they always come back to the same place its very predictable and not as natural as it should be. Anyways this is a early access game though and they have came out with some great updates that have made it better and I cant wait to see more! for me its a 7/10", "hours": 120.3, "user_id": "76561198202963627", "username": "savagehunter924", "products": 49, "found_helpful": 12, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

I'm holding a rock so I go knock some trees and rocks and get some stuff. I notice a boat nearby, obviously human built. I say fuggit and take it for a joyride to another island right off the bat. As I get there, another player flags me down.\nI follow him. He shows me how to hunt, how to build. how to survive. I ask him why he's helping me.

I guess...\nMost of these negative reviews are about CodeHatch and their prior projects. Games that didn't get finished or weren't complete, etc. With that in mind, you're considering buying an early access game. One would think that was expected, the game may not actually come out one day... That's the risk you take to be first.\nFor those of us that want the risk, to be first. That pride ourselves on getting into the action early. That don't mind spending a few dollars to check things out. This game is worth the buy. If the $20 price tag makes you cringe and you want to cry over devs... Please go buy a sandwich instead.\nAs for the actual game, here's the EARLY ACCESS REVIEW.... EARLY ACCESS.\nIt's not yet optimised. It takes a bit of a beast to run it. I run an i7,8700k. 16gb ram, 1070GTX, SSD. I'm averaging about 40fps on ultra. It dips to 10fps to 40fps depending on how fast I run and let the terrain ahead load.\nAnimations are there, but not finished. The crafting system works for the most part, but all features don't exist yet. Like animals you can kill, skin, eat. But I there's a menu wheel full of grayed out options. Maybe I'm just not high enough level yet?\nI've crashed about 4 times in 14 hours. One time the game thought I was still in the server so I restarted Steam, that resolved it.\nI don't know about these poor people and their complaints about CodeHatch. I spent $20 on this and already got 14 hours out of it, and those were fun hours. At about $1/hr I'm feeling like I'll get at least another 100 hours of this early access, glitchy game.\nTry it for yourself, but remember it's early access. You're paying to be first, first to play. First to hope it gets finished. First to hope your HUGE investment of $20 pays off... The server I'm on, North America 1, or something like that, has a great community so far, and we're all helping each other learn the game.

These devs have never completed a game on steam yet they continue to take gamers money.  They are scammers and should be avoided at all costs.\nTheir first game (if you could call it that) Starforge was released on steam in 2013, the game trailer looked amazing and Codehatch made so many promises of what the game would be.  But before it was even released on steam the game had already made 135k from crowdfunding.  Once everyone watched the trailer that was nothing like the game, they sold thousands of copies, some people even paid for the 75$ founders edition.  The game would go on to release minor patches that did mostly nothing and after a few years the game was completly abandoned however Codehatch left the game for sale to continue to milk the community.  The finished product was a steaming pile, it was more of a concept demo, it was nothing close to what they had promised.  Codehatch never released any communication about their abortion of a game and eventually removed Starforge from steam to try and coverup the thousands of negative reviews.  Even the positive reviews are sarcastic negative reviews.  Let me link you what they don't want you to see\nGood luck finding anything positive said about these Devs.\nThe next game Reign of Kings that they released is also an aborted pile of steaming garbage.  In 2018 2 patches were released, last patch was released right before the announcment of Heat, this was done to make it look like some development was still being done in ROK to help drive heat sales, however its a dead game overun by hackers, plagued with bugs and again was never finished.  ROK is abandoned just like Starforge and just like Starforge it stays on steam market and Rok is still raking in gamers cash!\nCodehatch games are not games they are vaporware, broken promises, cash grabs.  These devs have never completed a single game.  They take advantage of what EA should really be.  They try to coverup and hide their lies.  They are getting rich off making amazing looking game trailers and a bunch of promises that they can't keep.  Heat will be abandoned in a few years after these devs get cash fill.

This studio has been plagued with producing great game concepts that were very poorly implemented. Heat has been long delayed so developers could fine tune game mechanics and graphics, I just hope they don't fall short apon delivery.\nUpdate after 6 hours of playing:\nI love this game already and it definatly does not deserve the hate it is getting from people with potato PC's. My 3 gen old PC build doesn't meet the GPU& CPU minimums and I'm getting 20-30 FPS at 1440P.\nThe Good\n-Very enjoyable. I honestly didn't think I'd have this much fun with the game.\n-Lots of things to do\n-Player interactions can be hillarous\n-Good progression system\n-Very pretty game\nThe Bad\n-Envrionment is very cluttered with lots of trees and stuff (I feel like this is causeing most of the lag)\n-The starting reaserchable items is very limited\n-NPC's will kick you to death and is hard to defend against as it pushes you away from melee\n-WW2 monument in pre-colonial game, this just kills the RP element for me\n-None of the buildings in Washington are enterable\n-Limited NPC's from what I've seen so far\nThe Ugly\n-Spawn Possitions are focused around Washington DC, this lead to alot of people spawning in on one another during the first hour of the game.\n-Train has no sound and killed 8 of us during an orgy on the tracks (can't make this up)\n-The progression system is slow\n-When you shoot the bow, it has a fallout feel to it as your camera follows the arrow. This sucks when you are fighting a group.\n-Building is badly managed, why do i need two tools to build?", "hours": 7.7, "username": "Pvtoneill", "products": 76, "found_helpful": 12, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

You gave to people too many servers so you dont have any populated servers that mean it is like magnet for ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who would like to play survival but they dont like to be killed by other player and once you have theese players there you will never have people who want to play true survival like hurtworld players or rust players... if you will not change or delete few servers just to increase population on FEW THEN YOU WILL SLOWLY DIE same way as Ravaged zombie apocalypse (truly nice game but devs ♥♥♥♥ed it with servers and afer a time it died ) DO SOMETHING WITH THAT DEVS!!!!!!!!! thank you", "hours": 16.7, "user_id": "76561198086262054", "username": "Hexxexx", "products": 73, "found_helpful": 2, "early_access": true}

I wear glasses, and am nearly blind without them, and get less \"flaring\" while outside on a sunny day. C'mon, lens flares were popular on consoles 10 years ago.\nHow this isn't an alpha is beyond me.\nMovement.... Well let's just say... It could use more than a bit of improvement. Run in a straight line and you're ok. Try to \"strafe\" even in the smallest iota, and you go from a jog to what seems to be a stumble. Dunno about the rest of the human race, but even as an overweight 35yr old dad of 2, I can still run sideways at a decent speed.\nGathering. God help you if you want to gather anything outside of stone and wood. If you are lucky and find flax, berries, or corn; then you have won the damn lottery. Fishing seems to be the best way to gather food, as you just need wood to make a net. If you get seeds while gathering a plant, you are fairly lucky. After traversing around 50% of the map, I have found 8 flax plants..... 1 seed.... Really.... 1 seed....\nSwimming. This is one of the worst mechanics in the game. Hands down. Try and swim for more than 10-15 seconds, and you start to die. Why? No ♥♥♥♥ing clue. Hypothermia? Sharks? Aliens? Who knows.\nCrafting. While I like the crafting for buildings, crafting anything else is nails on a chalkboard. Clunky UI, bad tooltips, crap instructions, etc...\nLast really big gripe is the servers. 5 pve servers, the rest are pvp mixed. between that , and the fact that the servers are clutterred with crap building all over the place, you really can't enjoy just building. Even if you want to PvP, good luck. Being a noob on a pvp server where resources are nigh on impossible to obtain, is nothing more than a campfest for those who were early arrivers.\nLast note, having a logout timer is ok for pvp, but on a pve server, dumb as hell.\nWould I buy the game again? no. Not for more than $5\nCan I get my money back? Nope, left the game running while afk dealing with my kids and went over the 2 hr mark.\nShould you get this game?

Rhinos,Tigers,Hippos,Gizelles are just a few that I've seen.\nSadly that's where the pros stop.\nThe graphics are awful, the movement animation looks like you walk around with a stick lodged firmly in your♥♥♥♥♥ There are way too many menus for each thing you do,the controls feel muddy and last,but not least, All of the servers are pretty much empty with alot of player created empty buildings that just take up space.

Boy was I wrong. I am a huge Rust player (540h) so I know what a decent game in this genre should be like and this game FAILS HARD in every aspect.\nFew pros:\n. A slight sliver of RPG style abilitie leveling.\n. I like the cave element.\n. Being able to move from island to island via boat is a good Idea.\nCons, Cons, and more Cons:\n.Extremelly poor performance, Can play FC4, BF4, and Witcher 3 on high with 60fps but am forced to play this game on the lowest of settings to get decent fps, and at that point this game looks like garbage. Everquest 1 comes to mind?\n.No players, 5 max  in any server is the highest iv seen.\n.The few players on a server are completely geared and KOS you out of shear bordom (its not the games fault, and I see where the players are coming from, bordom. And I cant imagine having more would be any more fun)\n.Hunting is a joke and extremely hard for early game players.\n.Food resources can be extremely difficult to come by, be prepared to starve.\n.The map is FILLED, like everywhere you look filled, with half built deserted shantys and large towers that drop fps even more.\n.Grind, and lots of it. Be prepared to put hours in hitting trees and stones with a rock  in order to even get a foundation down, but beware of the few geared players. Its definetly not attractive puttings hours in for little return just to be one hitted.\n.Lack of items. I never got to the point of having bronze gear (tier 3), but is that end game? like really?\n.Crafting is simple, a bad joke.\nConclusion: Its early access, I got what I payed for.  Being a huge fan of this genre of games, I would not spend a dime on this one, The lack of players and abundence of deserted beginning-game bases shows you that this game is not ready\nfor your money nor time. I few games I would recomend for a player looking for a survival sandbox would be; Rust, The Forest, Space Engineers, Medevil Engineers, 7 days to die, H1Z1, Arma 3 Exile mod, Minecraft, Reign of Kings or Grav.", "hours": 4.1, "user_id": "76561198073945981", "username": "DarkOdysseus", "products": 79, "found_helpful": 32, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": true}

Running it on my laptop seems to have no problems.  Where as Rust and the Forest seem to still have issues every now and then.  The game is definitely interesting because of the fact that you can build anywhere (That has its pros and cons; if you continue reading some of the reviews someone points out the cons.)   But a key thing to remember about the game is that its only fairly new, so content in the matter of gear and balancing gear is very far off.  I am curious as to where they are going to take the game.   Because right now they could even take it to a mythological point.  Just by looking at what is in the game, the developers could add in Dragons, Sea-Serpeants, Sphinxs, and other things like that (you know as like end game type of mobs), as a potential end game set for players who spend alot of time playing.\nSo my actual review.\nPros: Respawning Resources unlike The Forest or Rust.  The trees in this game respawn, so you do not have to worry about coming into a new server and worrying about \"Well will I have materials to make a base.\"\nThe base foundation for the game is well done, gardening is done well.  You can grow food and not have to worry about having to hunt for food all the time, afk fish (fish traps), or if you want to hunt, with the skill leveling you can get more food as you hunt more.\nThere is a level system and skills.  Killer, Hunter, Gatherer, Smith, Logger, Miner.   Only two kills at the moment; Charge (Faster Running) and Better Aim.\n\nCons: I have noticed while I was trying to find friends, you generally spawn in the same areas.  Unless you have a bed down.  Because of spawning in the same areas you have the potential to spawn inside of a players prebuilt base.  Worse case senario that guy built he base so that new players can't get out.\nAs of right now since the game is new, you run out of things to do after a few hours of play, unless you continue to upgrade your base.\nOverall I am very statified with the game for being very new and being able to run on my laptop and desktop very well.\n(PS game devs: if you actually take the time to read this and decide that adding in dragons and what not; do not add in magic, magic abilities are generally game breaking.  Dragon Armor; Sphinx Treasure, Sea-Serpeant weapons.  Make the game more Melee or Range.  I don't think this type of game will be fair if you add in magic because of the fact that some spells will be impossible to truely nerf.  But if you really want to add some spells like Magical Door Barrier (only breakable after Many hits with a terbuchet, than add it into the drop tables for The mythical creatures...

First off, this is an early Alpha review - things could change, and usually do.  Second, the game is not so much an established work in progress as a technology demontrator and is probably at least a year and possibly two from being worth spending money on.\nSo how does the game work?  You show up on an island, which I call starvation island.  That is a good name because there really is not much food there.  You are on a beach where \"slow moving creatures live.\"  My beach was about 75 meters long and had no plants, animals, rocks (except for the rock I was holding) and only some water on one side and a steep climb to the main feature of the island, which is featurless rock mountains.  No worries.  You have, afterall, just ended up on a deserted island (or not so deserted, you have heard tales) and it is up to you to survive.  Given the steepness of the ascent, it seems safest to swim to a better location.\nBig mistake.  All of those classes at the Y are wasted, and you started to drown just a minute into the swim.  You turn around and arrive back at starvation beach (which will confuse people as I have also named the mountain starvation mountain and the island, if you remember, was already called starvation.\nSo the only way out is up.  It is on the way up you encounter your first tree.  Up until now you have no way to tell where your island is, but now you tree tells you that the island is tropical as you find an oil palm, a date palm, and what looks like an exotic paradise tree all clining to some rocks.  By this time you are starving, half dead, and no further along at saving yourself, so you haved no other option but to slam the rock into the tree, remember many days playing mine crat.  It pays off, and you soon cut the tree down, being rewarded with wood.  Hopefully you slam your rock into other things are are not rewarded with anything.\nIf you are used to games where the land is infinitely mallable such as WURM, LIF, or Planet Explorers, you will be disapointed with the throwback to 2006.  Some objects in the land can be smashed up, but I was unable to find any evidence of the landscape being modified by players.  Instead most trees were individual entities and when they get chopped down they disapeer.  This could explain why the world I was in seemed barren as over-exploitation and splurge levelling often destroyes true sandbox games as players first level harvesting, then level crafting my making enless numbers of junk structures.\nI soon found human habitation.  The sparce tropical vegetation and nude mountains that implied a water starved island out of the trade winds lead to a surreal copy of the South African veld holding the island's interior.  And with a flash my suspension of disbelief was lost.\nThe first creature I saw was a Bengal tiger.  Or maybe it was a Java tiger.  And it was sitting in what looked like an asian steppe environment.  And no island has this sort of steppe that I have ever seen.\nThere are savanna's on larger islands.  Tristan da Cunha has one.  And I have seen a colder, wetter version of this off Nova Scotia.  But no island that could possibly have a collection of Bengal tigers on it should have a large, African type savanna.\nThen I stumbled on a corn plant.  And quickly a wheat plant.\nFor the educated player, what island has tigers, dry savanna biome, sparse tropical vegetation, and also hosts short throwback corn and wheat.  Oh, and flax - very accurately rendered as a little blue-flowered plant.\nQuickly I was chased by what seemed to be a hippo (or rhino  - you cannot look over your shoulder when you are panic running) and I chased a gazelle and I knew that the art department had made a fundemental mistake - they had probably not invested the time researching their subject and putting their vision onto storyboards.\nSo, soon I was over the island.  I played with other people's houses, harvesting flax and throwing it into their footlockers, and I (finally) found a rock that could be harvested.  I also noted that while I could make a trebuchet, a boat only Gilligan would love, and a glider, I could not make a spear, club, or scraper, all of which would make more immediate sense than trying to find a vein of tin to start into the metal trade.\nThat was when I found the ship.  100 meters from shore, and fetched up tight.  An easy swim (well, a deadly one but one I could survive by eating right before I enered the water.  The ship was a wrecked rig, a very small, almost dinkly sail ship.  Here was what a survivor needed.  I thought of what on Pyrates said about ship wrecks, they are full of odds and ends that can help you survive.  Rope, and brass fittings, and lock mechnaism, and even biscuit and junk.  So I reisked it all and made it to the ship, only to discover it was a 3/4 size prop.\nIn conclusion - Out of Reach is a stable release alpha of a game that does not have any game yet, and needs some serious rethinking on its art and paradigms.", "hours": 0.4, "username": "jacksste", "products": 33, "found_helpful": 18, "found_funny": 6, "early_access": true}

I love survival, building games (minus minecraft.. can't get past the 8-bit resolution of it lol) Anyway, the mechanics of building are very similar to early rust alpha. The play and graphics seem more similar to that of ARK, with a bit of Reign of Kings action.. Which is a really awesome concept for a game! Only thing wrong was the population.. There were only a couple of servers with more than one person on them. The screen was also in a weird format. This game has a lot of potential, I mean A LOT of potential, to be an amazing game. I do recommend trying it, I will be following it some more, and possibly redownloading this game in the future.

Of course as more information comes out we will see this game advance fairly quick. I have to make a few points of which impressed me the most about the game!\n1:The graphics are truly spended, once you submerge yourself into the island life you will see that very quickly you will become apart of the game. Unlike Ark, I don't have to worry at all about my FPS at any time and my distance is max! The ocean and sky could use some more art but other then that the islands look perfect and the wildlife that follow too!\n2:You're not a god and cannot run forever to escape a fight. This game does rely on some type of a tactic, you can attack front on or keep your distance; but it will run out sooner then you think. The stamina system is great because it cannot recharge super fast for anyone to do a hit n' run tactic instead short burst are what will determine life or death. The charge button works great for a shielded enemy if you are a archer to run up and cut you down but similarly a bowman can get distance enough for 1 shot. I prefer the bow to most attacks due to (my personal) skill with the bow.\n3:The community is slowly going to KOS on sight, not to bad and most people are willing to help you or at least give you something. Don't expect many people to be so nice, especially in groups! Normally they are looking for someone or... You if you're unlucky..\nNow of course there is some bad...\n1:Renegade system needs to be improved (A LOT) because if you get attacked by someone who is neutral even if they hit you first, the moment you attack them back you are considered to be a bandit. The game doesn't register it correctly and the only way you won't get it is if you attack someone with a red name (Majority of the red names were protecting themselves from KOSing people). I already encountered many noobs thinking it would be a good idea to attack me because I am red... Doesn't work that way.. :D\n2:Sounds, something that seriously needs to be looked into is the sound system in the game. Many of the animals make noises but aren't really correct. I mean the Zebra sounds like a damn hyenna most of the time which at the begenning of the game will completely throw you off. Same with many of them, but most seriously is when someone is talking it sounds like they are in a toilet and there getting flushed! You'll learn this as you go...\n3:More stuff!!! This will come in time but at the moment there is a lot but once you get ahang of things its pretty easy to get supplies and craft whatever is needed. Its a grinder game but with a lot of mixed feeling, you'll want to becareful of loosing everything but at the same time you will need to get more supplies. Overall, base building is safe 90% of the time but if you're not careful and protect it someone can lay down a fire to burn you alive.\n4:Finally, the AI... Most of the animals are so stupid compared to what they would be like in other games. They simply respawn exactly where you kill them and its almost like farming animals. Once you get yourself ontop of something they cannot kill you and will run back. During this time you can kill it..\nOverall, 7.5/10 improvement is always coming but for now it deserves more players and funding...", "hours": 64.4, "user_id": "76561198117936118", "username": "SkyHard805", "products": 25, "found_helpful": 6, "early_access": true}

I wanted to give this a full 24 hours to make sure it was a sufficient fix, and that it seemed to last, before updating my review.\nAs of this change, and having given it time to settle in, it seems that this issue has been resolved.  Connecting is smooth, still a little painful, it can take a few minutes to connect to the game even with a high-speed connection, but you expect issues like that with an Early Access game.  The rest of the review is still applicable.  I am now enjoying the game, though, instead of having a useless game in my library.  :)\nOriginal 8/25  This game required port forwarding to play, and once you have set up port forwarding, there is a more than small chance that you will still be unable to connect to their servers.  They are unhelpful about this issue on the forums, seeming unconcerned once they have your money, because you will spend so much time trying to connect to the servers (which counts as playtime), that Steam will reject your refund request.\nThat being said, this game has potential.  I would describe it as a low-budget version of Ark.  The mechanics and gameplay are very similar, but the attention to detail and graphics are lacking.

(PvE you can't steal peoples stuff or injure them.)\n- Good graphics and combat for an early access game.\n- Using the Bow is fun and difficult; the further you get from your target the higher you must aim.\n- Lots of craftable items and building parts with more to come.\n- A Map (press m) to find your friends or to know where you are. (What you explored is what you see.)\n- Creepy Caves to explore.\n- Swimming kills stamina which eventually can end bad if you wander, or in this case, swim too far.\n- Many Islands to explore.\n- Build forts, castles or shacks and defend them!\n- Collecting and mining system works a bit differently than in other games; as you mine, gather or chop you collect during the process. (Example: Each axe hit will give you +1,+2,+3  wood until the tree falls.)\n- Character skill and leveling up system. The more you use your skills the better you become. Auto level up. (Think of Oblivion or Skyrim, but very simplified.)\n- Easy to find a decent server.\nQuestionable features:\n- Need more animals (potentially bugs and ocean life), plants, recipies, and stuff to collect but the amount there is so far is actually very decent for an early access survival game.\n- Building can be annoying if you are not used to how it works. Trail and error.\n- Tearing down structures can be tedious.\n- A lot of open water. There is no point in exploring the corners or sides of the map.\n- The animal AI is dumb at the moment. (That's good news for all you people who like to hunt without much of a challenge.)\n- No thirst system.\n- Falling trees can't hurt you. :P\n- The boat works but can be annoying to use without a buddy. (I got dizzy exploring all 4 corners of the map...And to know it was all for nothing...)\n- In PvE servers you don't have to worry about being looted or returning to the server only to find your fort destroyed or stolen. That being said, there are no threats other than some peaceful animal predators. Maybe this is why there aren't many PvE servers.\nOverall I recommend this game for all you folks who enjoy multiplayer survival games, frequent updates, collecting/exploring, crafting, and building. It is an impressive early access title.\nSurvival Rating: 7.8/10", "hours": 33.1, "user_id": "76561198029043678", "username": "Unearthly Earthling", "products": 678, "found_helpful": 16, "early_access": true}

Great game for what I'm comparing it too that has it's own style.  Content still isn't fully there - need more animals, gear and some terrain additions for sure, but gameplay is very addictive.  I would call it a mix between ROK, LIF and Rust.  There are no sleepers which some of you may enjoy - when you log off your stuff own your body is safe.  It's nice but also a little lame after playing so many sleeper games.\nRaiding is interesting, you can break doors easy but can't loot boxes if the person has a building station which you have to destroy and then wait for a time to expire (3 hrs+) before you can look the boxes.  I thought this was really lame at first but it adds a new dimension of exploring, finding a raided base full of loot and you didn't do the raiding.  It's like finding buried treasure.\nI will keep playing for a while, seems a bit too easy at the moment.  I have about 15 hours in and can get full bronze equip, boat, etc.  I raid and kill people pretty easily but have also gotten killed.\nNot sure when people were saying there isn't much KOS because I was KOSed so much the first day that I'm playing it like Rust now - kill first and ask questions later.\nHope you join us because it really needs more players.  Servers seem to max out at about 20 players at some point in the day right now and even though it's decent, we could use more.\nOh I forgot to mention fires!  When someones building permissions expire you can set their base on fire and burn it down.  This is lovely to watch and works great for cleaning up the abandoned buildings.\nWhen you first start, look for an abandoned base that already has a furnace and an anvil.  Put your own building station in and add some doors and it will be your base.  This is what I did on my first play through and it helped speed things up alot because those tools were already there for me.\nGet it while it's on sale because it's worth $12 if you like survival games.", "hours": 144.8, "username": "CybrLrd", "products": 67, "found_helpful": 40, "found_funny": 4, "early_access": true}

I'm happy to say I finally pulled the trigger on Out of Reach a couple of weeks ago, and believe I made a great decision. Good enough to write my first review anyways!\nI wanted to be sure I had the hang of the game, as I heard crafting menus were strange and certain combat aspects were glitchy. I joined a pretty low-key server at the bottom of the list just to be sure my sub-par \"gaming\" laptop could handle it. So far so good, and the low population server is great because I'm not pressured to defend myself, grind for competing resources, or worry about how well my base is constructed. Whether you view low player count as a positive or negative, I do feel pretty lonely when I'm 1/75 spots available...\nWith only 9.6 hours on record over the two week span (as of this review), I've progressed much further than I anticipated. Instead of constantly griding to survive, I've spent a good chunk of time crafting useful items, exploring, getting plowed by rhinos, and investigating some of the abandoned bases that those before me have left behind. Just the other day, the devs released gliders, which will allow you to fly around the map. I haven't had the chance to try it out, but it is nice to see notable updates already.\nIf you're looking for a great survival type game, this is it. I'm really excited to see what other features are released in the future, and hope I'm able to convince some fellow gamers to join in and populate these servers. There is so much potential to be shared, and I hope this has provided a bit of insight from a somewhat casual gamer's perspective.\nEDIT: I revised/removed my original (and unfair) comments comparing it to Day Z.", "hours": 24.3, "user_id": "76561198048545615", "username": "CoyoteChris", "products": 44, "found_helpful": 91, "found_funny": 15, "early_access": true}

Annoying, things out of the way. Yes, i do understand the game is still an early access and yes they do have a long way to go, but the devs are juggling a lot right now, trying to get the optimization just right and fixing bugs as well as adding new content. Although they do seem to skip over some stuff like arrows glitching and such. but most of the stuff that is Wrong is very minor, thank god it isn't major otherwise i wouldn't have played for as long as i have. As of right now the Game has a Cap, there is no goal that is \"Out of Reach\", if you knew what you were doing you could probably have full bronze equipment in a few hours. The player base is Very small therefore making it hard to enjoy with others seeing as how they have a HUGE server list making it to where the players can go to different servers starting anew on each one. the only real downside i see to that is that the game isn't popular enough for them to need that many servers. The servers can become very...Cluttered, as well. many of the people who buy the game then quit leave their stuff behind, I.e. Buildings that have been claimed and cant be gotten rid of. so it does cause some frame issues when you have a lot of buildings to register on your screen. again not major stuff just minor irritants.\nNow time for the stuff I do like a lot about the game. I myself and some of the other people i happen to play with are very friendly, now im not gonna say everyone is because this game is a survival and fighting is part of the learning process. the game has a very easy crafting system and building is fun and easy as well. you can do a lot in the game. even with a \"Cap\" on what you can do. i still have fun by just going hunting or talking with the other players. you dont have to fight but its a good way to enjoy the game and if you can find enough people to enjoy it with, there is even a clan system so you can set a base and work your way from there. the bugs are very minor and hardly noticeable unless you go looking for them, and when they do happen you can simply log out and log back in to reset your connection to the server. this game is very fun and i still have a blast fighting players with the same set of skills as me, they recently added farming and they plan to expand that even more, the Devs work hard and i applaud them for their efforts they are very consistent with keeping the players informed and are always providing responses fairly quickly for players having issues with the game.\nIts not a lot about the game, just some key subjects but its on its way to becoming better than what it started as. my only suggestions are adding extra items to the game, such as better weapons and armor crafting. but if you want something to kill time and people with a satisfactory hut or fort or tower to lay your head at then this game is for you. Recommend it to your friends, start a clan, fight the raiders or be the raiders.\nHonestly a damn good survival 10/10", "hours": 639.8, "username": "Nr.9 Killathebeast", "products": 98, "found_helpful": 22, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

The button clicks from the menu and most of the ambient noise is coming through my rear 2 surround speakers and is throwing me off a bit because I had no clue what those clicking noises were until I put 2-and-2 together. Also with the breathing noises and pretty much every other recorded bit of audio, the static-y beginning and end of each audio clip can be heard. If it were subtle things I wouldn't point them out but they're brazenly obvious so I'm just giving you (the dev mostly) a heads up that you may wanna tweak your audio a tad.\nOverall though, the gameplay felt nice. Obviously didn't play it for very long but the movement was good, animations were decent for pre-alpha and most likely self-rendered so bravo on that.\nTo be honest, I feel the game is probably worth about half of what it goes for currently. The game looks, feels and sounds like a very well enhanced survival game developed in the mid 2000's. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just that just because there's an overwhelmingly large amount of things to see and do, it doesn't mean said stuff is all that pretty (again, not a bad thing especially at this state). But granted, this is an Early Access game so you guys definitely have time to spruce up a lot of that stuff pre-launch while tending to the more intricate gameplay matters.\nI'm reccomending this for the future versions of the game. I can tell where this game wants to end up and I can tell the dev team wants to get it there and it's only been in Early Access for two weeks.\nI'm excited to see how things look and feel in the next 3 or 4 months.

I have only played alone on a server so far, but being a loner, that suits me quite perfectly ;)\nSo I had managed to mine enough tin + copper ( = bronze in the furnace) to make a pickaxe head. Well, so I thought, until I found out that I needed more bronze for an anvil to refine the pickaxe head before I could assemble it. The anvil needed more bronze, so another trip to the cave, deeper into it this time, and back to build the anvil. But I soon found out that laying the raw pickaxe head on the anvil and hammering it with my stone axe was futile. I needed more bronze to make a special hammer for the anvil. This time I had to search even deeper into the cave until I had enough tin and copper. I ran back in the direction of the cave entrance. But suddenly I was falling down!\nI must have turned wrong direction somewhere. Images from my short OOR-life were flickering through my mind while I was falling, until I brutally and painfully landed on some stalagmites at the bottom. But I was still alive, though barely! Luckily I had brought enough red berries with me to heal myself almost fully up. I had also brought one extra torch into the cave, but had been forced to lit it in the middle of my last mining. I didn't know how long that one would last. At least my stomach was filled up due to the red berries. I started to walk. After a while I saw light in front of me. Really? There was a lower entrance into the cave system? But, the entrance was covered with planks, and the daylight only shined through the openings between them. I tried to axe my way out for a minute, but with no luck.\nShort-sighted as I was, I had forgot to put away my torch when hammering on the planks. I decided to do a last search for another entrance in the cave system while I still had light in my torch. After a bit running here and there, I seemed to achieve nothing. The torch only threw a dim light on the cold cave walls, and I started to panic and think that I would die deep inside the cold mountain. Without the torch I would see nothing at all. It would become pitch black. When I almost had lost all hope, I suddenly found a way that went upwards. And upwards! And upwards, until it flattened out. But which direction should I run? I tried to run in one direction, but it felt wrong. I turned the other way and ran back. I had lost valuable torch-time, and now there was no more time to lose if I should ever make it out of the caves. I ran and ran, chose directions at intersections at random, and suddenly I vaguely saw a very dim light in front of me. Shortly after I ran out of the cave-system through another opening than the one I went into.\nAnd the torch went out!", "hours": 19.2, "username": "enulun", "products": 87, "found_helpful": 10, "found_funny": 1, "early_access": true}

I have noticed that certain servers do lag potentially where you are from.\n- A lot of stuff to do the Change in time was frustrating at first, but the community spoke and the Devs listened. The game has great changes.\n- Good community so far the addition of PVE servers makes it even better it gives you time to experience the game without the frustration of getting slaughtered by higher level or more experienced players.\n-Great graphics for an Alpha with any official game release I expect improvements to the graphics.\n-Building Mechanics are really easy. I enjoy the skills attached to this and how less items are required the more you work the skill. Adds replay value to the game.\nCons:\n- Too many servers the player base is too split up. With a Smaller Player base we need maybe 10 total servers.\n- Non PVE servers can be frustrating starting but that can be said for any PVP game you are new to.\n- As for negative reviews please remember the time they spent playing the game was limited.
